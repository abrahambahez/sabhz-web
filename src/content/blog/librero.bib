  abstract = {Over the past decade, the DNA ancestry-testing industry---based largely in the United States---has experienced a huge upsurge in popularity, thanks partly to rapidly developing technologies and the falling prices of products. Meanwhile, the notion of ``genetic genealogy'' has been strongly endorsed by popular television documentary shows in the US, particularly vis-{\`a}-vis African-American roots-seekers---for whom these products are offered as a means to discover one's ancestral ``ethnic'' origins, thereby ``reversing the Middle Passage.'' Yet personalized DNA ancestry tests have not had the same reception among people of African descent in other societies that were historically affected by slavery. This paper outlines and contextualizes these divergent responses by examining and comparing the cultural and political meanings that are attached to notions of origin, as well as the way that Blackness has been defined and articulated, in three different settings: the United States, France and Brazil.},

In the late 1960s a few key works stimulated the growth of a complex body of literature, now defined by four main theoretical approaches. New insights are also emerging. Chief among these is the importance of integrating intersectionality into ethnicity theory. The Institute of Development Studies (IDS) has also made important contributions to this literature and its application to development studies. This article identifies three new frontiers in the study of ethnicity. First, theoretical effort is required to unpack how ethnicity intersects with other forms of identity. Second, as demonstrated by IDS' contributions, further research is required on the impacts of ethnicity upon development and vice versa. And, finally, the geopolitical landscape emerging since 9/11 has stimulated major shifts in conceptions of ethnicity. These shifts and the resulting new framings of identity (ethnic and otherwise) beg investigation.},

In this literature review, we developed a narrow operational definition for ``classroom research'' compared to previous reviews of the literature. We screened nearly 2000 abstracts and systematically coded 50 experiments to establish a clearer picture of benefits from retrieval practice in real world educational settings. Our review yielded 49 effect sizes and a total n = 5374, the majority of which (57\%) revealed medium or large benefits from retrieval practice. We found that retrieval practice improved learning for a variety of education levels, content areas, experimental designs, final test delays, retrieval and final test formats, and timing of retrieval practice and feedback; however, only 6\% of experiments were conducted in nonWEIRD countries. Based on our review of the literature, we make eight recommendations for future research and provide educators with a better understanding of the robust benefits of retrieval practice across a range of school and classroom settings.},

The assessment of the two political parties is made in advance, between one and two months before the elections. The design includes both political parties, so the hypothesis tested is about the relationship between performance appraisal and governmental party management with their election results (Downs, 1957). That is, the effectiveness of the retrospective voting model to explain and anticipate electoral results in general elections in Spain. The calls for papers are the general elections in Spain in 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2011 and 2015. The evaluation data come from the Centre for Sociological Research and the election results of the Ministry of the Interior. After testing the hypotheses of association and dependence between the anticipated retrospective voting and the electoral results, it is concluded that the performance / management indicator of the PP and the PSOE has, in advance of one to two months, an association and significant explanatory power of electoral results. The predictive power, on the other hand, is low. Due to the sample size, the two political parties are included in the same model. Also, an analysis of the statistical power of several models is carried out, comparing different specifications.},

  abstract = {Wiki software has historically provided little support for any form of organizational structure. Even given the assumption that the majority of wiki users have previous experience with file system-like hierarchies, most wiki systems keep things simple (as is the wiki way) and employ a flat page structure. As a wiki grows beyond a few dozen pages, some form of organization becomes increasingly necessary. This has typically been accomplished by adding ``category links'' to each page, essentially ad hoc terms from an unstructured and uncontrolled vocabulary. Because these terms are themselves often undefined it can be difficult to ascertain the reason why a given page belongs to a category. Even when this is done carefully, as the number of terms in the categorization grows a classification scheme for the terms themselves likewise becomes increasingly necessary. This paper describes problems with existing wiki and ``semantic wiki'' categorization schemes and outlines an approach to information organization that avoids the pitfalls of computer-based ontologies by instead looking to library science for solutions. It describes the design and implementation of a wiki system permitting user-authored assertions , which are dynamically harvested to create a Topic Map graph mirroring the explicit structure of the wiki and providing it with an underlying classification system.},

  abstract = {In this introduction to the special section ``Computing in/from the South,'' we position the South as a method to change dominant frames about the past, present, and future of computing. We discuss three narratives frames---developmentalist, postcolonial, and decolonial---to trace a significant body of thinking on computing otherwise. We argue that each of these frames provides a different optic to emphasize the contributions of non-Western, feminist, and queer epistemologies to computing worlds. Rather than thinking of these co-constructions as replacing one another linearly, we argue that they each create a different kind of relation among computing's spaces and places, its pasts and its futures. These relations, and the switches between them, comprise what we describe as computing in/from the South as both an empirical and a methodological framework. The introduction first centers developments in computing worlds that are taking place outside centers of power. Based on an analysis of these developments, we then move beyond the limited twinned frames of exploitation and resistance to unpack the relational, political, and affective undercurrents that run through data-driven worlds from perspectives in and through the South.},

  abstract = {Researchers frequently experience sexualized interactions, sexual objectification, and harassment as they conduct fieldwork. These experiences are often left out of ethnographers' ``tales from the field'' and remain unaddressed within qualitative literature. In Harassed: Gender, Bodies, and Ethnographic Research (University of California Press, 2019), Rebecca Hanson and Patricia Richards argue that the androcentric, racist, and colonialist epistemological foundations of ethnographic methodology contribute to the silence surrounding sexual harassment and other forms of violence. Hanson and Richards challenge readers to recognize how these attitudes put researchers at risk, further the solitude experienced by researchers, lead others to question the validity of their work, and, in turn, negatively impact the construction of ethnographic knowledge. To improve methodological training, data collection, and knowledge produced by all researchers, Harassed advocates for an embodied approach to ethnography that reflexively engages with the ways in which researchers' bodies shape the knowledge they produce. By challenging these assumptions, the authors offer an opportunity for researchers, advisors, and educators to consider the multiple ways in which good ethnographic research can be conducted. Beyond challenging current methodological training and mentorship, Harassed opens discussions about sexual harassment and violence in the social sciences in general. The authors brought up a couple of articles in the interview that they wanted to provide links to, in case listeners want to look these articles up: --Berry, Maya J., Claudia Ch{\'a}ves Arg{\"u}elles, Shanya Cordis, Sarah Ihmoud, and Elizabeth Vel{\'a}squez Estrada. 2017. ``Toward a Fugitive Anthropology: Gender, Race, and Violence in the Field.''

  abstract = {Despite centuries of colonialism, Yucatec Maya women and men retain a rich body of specialized culinary practices with roots in the pre-Columbian past. Recently this intangible heritage has become the focus of a variety of forms of culinary tourism, some of which are local enterprises that bring much needed cash into small rural communities. This article presents details about how a small group of women in the YucatecMaya speaking village of Yaxunah formed a cooperative to prepare ``Maya'' meals for visitors. They debate the relative authenticity of the dishes they serve as they negotiate the interests of tourists, economic pressures, and competing claims to heritage. Foodways are a powerful means by which local Maya communities construct and maintain a social identity distinct from dominant national discourse and globalized dietary trends. Likewise household gardens provide a site for the contestation of globalizing forces and the preservation of Maya cultural values. By positioning landscape features and cultural knowledge related to the intangible heritage of Maya culinary traditions within the worldwide tourism industry, this small group of indigenous women present a powerful lesson in adaptation to modern global forces.},

  abstract = {Psychologists have debated the form of the forgetting curve for over a century. We focus on resolving three problems that have blocked a clear answer on this issue. First, we analyzed data from a longitudinal experiment measuring cued recall and stem completion from 1 min to 28 days after study, with more observations per interval per participant than in previous studies. Second, we analyzed the data using hierarchical models, avoiding distortions due to averaging over participants. Third, we implemented the models in a Bayesian framework, enabling our analysis to account for the ability of candidate forgetting functions to imitate each other. An exponential function provided the best fit to individual participant data collected under both explicit and implicit retrieval instructions, but Bayesian model selection favored a power function. All analysis supported above chance asymptotic retention, suggesting that, despite quite brief study, storage of some memories was effectively permanent.},

  abstract = {"When you feel anxious, angry, happy, or surprised, what's really going on inside you? Most scientists would agree that emotions come from specific parts of the brain, and that we feel them whenever they're triggered by the world around us. The thrill of seeing an old friend, the sadness of a tear-jerker movie, the fear of losing someone you love - each of these sensations arises automatically and uncontrollably within us, finding expression on our faces and in our behaviour, and carrying us away with the experience. This understanding of emotion has been around since Aristotle. But what if it's wrong? In How Your Emotions Are Made, pioneering psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett draws on the latest scientific evidence to reveal that our ideas about emotion are dramatically, even dangerously, out of date - and that we have been paying the price. Emotions don't exist objectively in nature, Barrett explains, and they aren't pre-programmed in our brains and bodies; rather, they are psychological experiences that each of us constructs based on our unique personal history, physiology and environment. This new view of emotions has serious implications: when judges issue lesser sentences for crimes of passion, when police officers fire at threatening suspects, or when doctors choose between one diagnosis and another, they're all, in some way, relying on the ancient assumption that emotions are hardwired into our brains and bodies. Revising that conception of emotion isn't just good science, Barrett shows; it's vital to our wellbeing and the health of society itself" -- Provided by publisher},

This paper is devoted to explaining the Romanian concept of ``home'' as it is perceived by Romanian migrants who lived for long periods of time in western European countries. Interviews with Romanian migrants and Moldovan returned migrants, and participant observation during fieldwork revealed different levels of the psychological state of missing the home they departed from, the emotional underpinnings on having to manage life in two places, the concrete and spiritual significance of homemaking in a foreign country, the psychological undertones of ``home'' and ``host'' societies, questions on ``identity'' and ``belonging'', ethnic homeland attachments. The reality of pluri-local and/or trans-local identity, and of multi-located homes and specific transnational lifestyles is compared with Romanian collective memory and imaginary of ``home'' and the strong territorial attachments that are considered by autochthonous ethnopsychologies as part of the Romanian cultural intimacy. The paper analyses both residence (as the material cultures of home, such as design and commodities, the material world of objects that shape a home environment) and dwelling (meanings, values and beliefs, emotional significance of domesticity). For migrants, the various strategies of homemaking are connected in various ways with homesickness as not only longing for a specific residence, but a feeling of loss of a specific past that is even more accentuated for people in a diasporic condition.},

Se contrastaron los factores tradicionales de comportamiento electoral como variables independientes -identificaci{\'o}n partidista, las propuestas de los candidatos, los grupos de referencia y la sofisticaci{\'o}n pol{\'i}tica- que predicen la influencia de las encuestas. Dado los escasos estudios precedentes en la regi{\'o}n, se realiz{\'o} un ejercicio exploratorio de naturaleza mixta y de caso, utilizando una encuesta anal{\'i}tica en l{\'i}nea (n=209) y cinco grupos focales en cinco municipios (n=40 participantes). Los resultados arrojaron que las encuestas son muy consultadas, pero poco consideradas para formular el voto, en t{\'e}rminos absolutos y con relaci{\'o}n a otros factores de comportamiento electoral, en parte por una desconfianza hacia ellas. No obstante, se confirm{\'o} que los votantes informados, es decir, con mayores niveles de sofisticaci{\'o}n pol{\'i}tica, de nivel socioecon{\'o}mico m{\'a}s alto y que prestan m{\'a}s atenci{\'o}n a la campa{\~n}a, son quienes manifiestan una mayor influencia de las encuestas.

My fieldwork took place between 2013 and 2017, just before a newly formed leftist political party gained power after a century of rule by Mexico's ``revolutionary'' party. For self-identified ``disenchanted'' youth in Mexico, skeptical of the promises of social mobility by means of formal education, ``hacking'' emerged as a way to make sense of their futures in a precarious state and economy and as a way to let their ``code work'' intervene in narratives that had only delivered false hopes. Coworking spaces, hackathons, entrepreneurial initiatives, and neoliberal ``reforms'' were seldom differentiated by politicians. By immersing themselves in the code that underlies the technologies that promise developmentalist change, I show how fundamental coding principles become good to think with, alongside the institutions and systems responsible for reinstating unequal opportunities, iteration after iteration. Hacker-entrepreneurs used their code work to develop heuristics for analyzing the organization of entities and relationship between them, whether they were elements in a coding environment or actors in a political-economic environment.

Highly ephemeral but also highly visible, the hackathon functions as a critical site to examine how communities crystallize and evaporate, and how participants actively negotiate their hacker identities and practices across boundaries of nation, gender, race, and ethnicity. Popular discourse poses inclusivity within maker/hacker groups by proposing ways to get different or ``diverse'' participants to join events aimed at empowering their communities. I explore how members of marked groups are called upon to construct and manage these differences themselves within hacker spaces and ``maker'' formations. I first highlight how participants at the women's hackathon aligned themselves with structures of expertise as they negotiated normative constructions of gender and femininity. Hackers continue these negotiations when they get caught up in Mexican nationalist pushes for productivity. In the final section, I unpack a surprise visit by abuelitas (grandmothers), who taught everyone a lesson on the invisibilized labor that supports communities of hackers. In a space usually reserved for young makers who understand ``new'' technologies, they claimed their space within ``progress'' and reasserted undervalued domestic work as foundational for other type of work. By weaving these three threads together ethnographically, I suggest the ways in which differences become important as Latina hackers differentially position themselves, but also align themselves, with the contradictions of treating code work as coded labor.},

  abstract = {In writings on the open source software development model, it is often argued that it is successful as a result of the gift economy that embraces activities in online communities. However, the theoretical foundations for this argument are seldom discussed and empirically tested. Starting with the `classic' theories of gift giving, we discuss how they need to be developed in order to explain gift-giving practices in digital domains. In this paper, we argue that the gift economy is important, not only because it creates openness, but also because it organizes relationships between people in a certain way. Open source software development relies on gift giving as a way of getting new ideas and prototypes out into circulation. This also implies that the giver gets power from giving away. This power is used as a way of guaranteeing the quality of the code. We relate this practice to how gifts, in the form of new scientific knowledge, are given to the research community, and how this is done through peer review processes.},

Sin embargo, lo que aparece como un derecho natural del capital, para los trabajadores aparece como el control del capital sobre su comportamiento, ya sea que est{\'e}n de acuerdo (acomodaci{\'o}n) o no (resistencia). El proyecto est{\'a} inspirado en el trabajo de James C. Scott, quien ha se{\~n}alado la importancia de las ``formas de resistencia cotidianas''. La resistencia generalmente toma dos formas, colectiva (sindicatos y huelgas) e individual (comportamientos). En la literatura mexicana la l{\'i}nea divisoria entre el control del capital y el control del trabajo se ha estudiado principalmente en su forma colectiva. Este trabajo analiza las resistencias individuales de los trabajadores ferroviarios en los Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucat{\'a}n, durante los a{\~n}os revolucionarios en M{\'e}xico y en la Pen{\'i}nsula y muestra c{\'o}mo se alimentaron entre s{\'i} para aumentar gradualmente la esfera de control laboral sobre el lugar de trabajo. Los trabajadores se permitieron ser descuidados, beber en el trabajo, robar o ignorar las reglas del tiempo, ser beligerantes con la autoridad, sobre todo evitando el castigo m{\'a}s extremo: ser despedidos permanentemente. En este proceso, los datos sugieren que los trabajadores ferroviarios que colaboraron juntos en el patio de ferrocarriles se involucraron principalmente en la resistencia colectiva mientras que los que sacaban los trenes participaron principalmente en la resistencia individual. Sin embargo, en {\'u}ltima instancia, ambos grupos se beneficiaron de la interacci{\'o}n de ambos conjuntos de acciones, al menos hasta 1940.},

  abstract = {Since the 1980s, everyday racism has gained ground within the social sciences. However, the theory of everyday racism has not been properly adopted and, consequently, varies across different research fields. The main goal of this study is to improve the scientific rigor within research on everyday racism in  the   human   and social sciences. Following a review of the ground-breaking   work  of   Philomena  Essed,   three  main   components   in  everyday   racism literature are theoretically distilled and conceptualized: (1) repetitiveness and familiarity, (2) racism and (3) the interdependent link between micro-interactions and macro-structures. This is followed by a critical assessment of what everyday racism means and how it is assessed in research today, by performing a systematic electronic review of qualitative-methods papers. This   part   contains   three   suggestions   towards   a   more   complete   and   sophisticated understanding   of   everyday   racism.   Firstly,   the   concepts   of   everyday   racism   and microaggressions need to be disconnected from each other. Secondly, research should focus more on the symbiotic relation between micro-interactions and macro-structures and should also identify relevant situational features at the spatial meso-level. Lastly, it is important to be cautious of the  pitfall  of   cultural   determinism   that   is still a popular perspective in today's field of (everyday) racism.},

Deliberate practice is not the same as rote repetition. Rote repetition --- simply repeating a task --- will not by itself improve performance. Deliberate practice involves attention, rehearsal and repetition and leads to new knowledge or skills that can later be developed into more complex knowledge and skills. Although other factors such as intelligence and motivation affect performance, practice is necessary if not sufficient for acquiring expertise (Campitelli \& Gobet, 2011).},

The buffering effects vary across gender. Our findings thus add to the existing literature on the benefits of internal locus of control.},

Methods Between January and March 2015, 3018 participants between 18 and 65 years without severe comorbidity and no routine experience of cold showering were randomized (1:1:1:1) to a (hot-to-) cold shower for 30, 60, 90 seconds or a control group during 30 consecutive days followed by 60 days of showering cold at their own discretion for the intervention groups. The primary outcome was illness days and related sickness absence from work. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, work productivity, anxiety, thermal sensation and adverse reactions. Results 79\% of participants in the interventions groups completed the 30 consecutive days protocol. A negative binomial regression model showed a 29\% reduction in sickness absence for (hot-to-) cold shower regimen compared to the control group (incident rate ratio: 0.71, P = 0.003). For illness days there was no significant group effect. No related serious advents events were reported. Conclusion A routine (hot-to-) cold shower resulted in a statistical reduction of self-reported sickness absence but not illness days in adults without severe comorbidity.

But history can be unkind to scholars with such encyclopaedic interests. All too often these individuals are remembered for just one part of their valuable achievements. In this account, renowned cultural historian Peter Burke argues for a more rounded view. Identifying 500 western polymaths, Burke explores their wide-ranging successes and shows how their rise matched a rapid growth of knowledge in the age of the invention of printing, the discovery of the New World and the Scientific Revolution. It is only more recently that the further acceleration of knowledge has led to increased specialisation and to an environment that is less supportive of wide-ranging scholars and scientists. Spanning the Renaissance to the present day, Burke changes our understanding of this remarkable intellectual species},

It is our universal predicament that our projects do not always have their intended effects. Very probably we all share in the experience that often we cannot tell whether the project had any impact at all, so complex is the flux of historical changes that would have been going on anyway, and so many are the other projects that might be expected to modify the same indicators. It seems inevitable that in most countries this common set of problems, combined with the obvious relevance of social science research procedures, will have generated a methodology and methodological specialists focused on the problem of assessing the impact of planned social change. It is an assumption if this paper that, in spite of differences in the forms of government and approaches to social planning and problem-solving, much of this methodology can be usefully shared --- that social project evaluation methodology is one of the fields of science that has enough universality to make scientific sharing mutually beneficial. As a part of this sharing, this paper reports on program impact assessment methodology as it is developing in the United States today.},

ORDER YOUR PRESENT: find daily calm by prioritising and minimising your workload and tackling your to-do list in a more mindful and productive way. PLAN YOUR FUTURE: establish and appraise your short-term and long-term goals, plan more complex projects simply and effectively, and live your life with meaning and purpose. Like many of us, Ryder Carroll tried everything to get organised - countless apps, systems, planners, you name it. Nothing really worked. Then he invented his own simple system that required only pen and paper, which he found both effective and calming. He shared his method with a few friends, and before long he had a worldwide viral movement. Hundreds of thousands of Bullet Journal fans now spread the word and read Ryder's blog and newsletter. The system combines elements of a wishlist, a to-do list, and a diary. It makes it easy to get thoughts out of your head (an unreliable witness) and onto paper, to see them clearly and decide what to do about them. It helps you identify what matters, and set goals accordingly. By breaking long-term goals into small actionable steps, users map out an approachable path towards continual improvement, allowing them to stay focused despite the crush of incoming demands. But this is much more than a time management book. It's also a manifesto for what Ryder calls "intentional living": making sure that your beliefs and actions align. Even if you already use a Bullet Journal{\textregistered}, this book gives you new exercises to become more calm and focused, new insights on how to prioritise well, and a new awareness of the power of analogue tools in a digital world},

  abstract = {In this article, we review studies that contribute to the critical understanding of place attachment in contexts of infringement of the right to adequate housing, revealing tensions between the meanings of the communities as opposed to the governmental normative obligations. For this, and transiting between psychology, geography and cultural studies, we describe the importance of places for people, the positive, negative and ambivalent dimensions of place attachment and we inquire into the processes involved in the loss and transformation of places. From a transdisciplinary reflection, we advocate a critical approach, which implies to make visible different political elements that seem to be absent in hegemonic positivistic and socio-cognitive productions. In our conclusions, we developed the importance of considering these absences, proposing to incorporate the dimensions of ethics and social commitment, gender, race, class and the challenges of decolonizing knowledge.},

  abstract = {For a place that is so familiar, home is peculiarly difficult to define and to research. Based on an extended review of recent literature on home, the article shows that there is no place like `home' because people construct its image in memory and imagination. Home, it is argued, is imaged on many different levels. At a surface level, home is known in terms of its location, fabric, decoration, furnishing and amenity - it is a place that is known intimately. At a deeper level, home is defined in terms of the kinds of relationships people have, or would like to have, with others inside and outside of the home. Deeper still, home is a representation of cultural identity and provides a collective sense of social permanency and security. People rarely think about home at this level, it is argued, unless reappraisal is forced upon them by a significant life event like migration between cultures or because of cultural invasion from without. The article argues for an intensification of research that starts from the domestic sphere is order to explore how home life both shapes and reflects wider social continuities and changes.},

  abstract = {The thesis of the extended mind (ExM) holds that the material underpinnings of an individual's mental states and processes need not be restricted to those contained within biological boundaries: when conditions are right, material artefacts can be incorporated by the thinking subject in such a way as to become a component of her extended mind. Up to this point, the focus of this approach has been on phenomena of a distinctively cognitive nature, such as states of dispositional belief, and processes of planning and calculation. In this paper, we aim to expand the scope of ExM by considering the case for extended affectivity. We begin by clarifying the central commitments of ExM, before investigating its applicability to a range of affective phenomena, both dispositional and occurrent. We argue that proponents of ExM should also accept that the vehicles of emotions, moods, sentiments, temperaments, and character traits can extend beyond skull and skin.},

In this book, Paul Connerton discusses social and cultural memory by looking at the role of mourning in the production of histories and the reticence of silence across many different cultures. In particular he looks at how memory is conveyed in gesture, bodily posture, speech and the senses - and how bodily memory, in turn, becomes manifested in cultural objects such as tattoos, letters, buildings and public spaces. It is argued that memory is more cultural and collective than it is individual. This book will appeal to researchers and students in anthropology, linguistic anthropology, sociology, social psychology and philosophy"--},

  abstract = {This article explores situations in which forced migrants revisit places and homes they had fled from, drawing on research carried out among Kashmiri Hindus, better known as Pandits, who were displaced following the outbreak of conflict in Jammu and Kashmir in 1990. Due to the breakdown of law and order, selective attacks, and a climate of fear, most of the community had relocated from the Kashmir valley to the south in Jammu and to even cities such as New Delhi, constituting one of the most prominent groups of Internally Displaced Persons in the region. While there is an interest in repatriation/resettlement in scholarship and policy, the experiences of the Pandits reveal the multiple meanings `return' holds for the displaced. This article will draw on the experiences of Pandit forced migrants in Jammu who have returned to visit Kashmir. Their experiences will be situated with work on return migration, the Kashmir conflict, and the political location of the Pandits in the region. The article argues that return migration is an inconclusive phenomenon that critically raises questions of home and uncertainty, and provides a way to understand how the displaced locate themselves in the world.},

  abstract = {While over the last decades, much attention has been paid to the mental workload in the field of human computer interactions, there is still a lack of consensus concerning the factors that generate it as well as the measurement methods that could reflect workload variations. Based on the multifactorial Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), our study aims to provide some food for thought about the subjective and objective measurement that can be used to disentangle the intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load. The purpose is to provide insight into the way cognitive load can explain how users' cognitive resources are allocated in the use of hypermedia, such as an online newspaper. A two-phase experiment has been conducted on the information retention from online news stories. Phase 1 (92 participants) examined the influence of multimedia content on performance as well as the relationships between cognitive loads and cognitive absorption. In Phase 2 (36 participants), eye-tracking data were collected in order to provide reliable and objective measures. Results confirmed that performance in information retention was impacted by the presence of multimedia content such as animations and pictures. The higher number of fixations on these animations suggests that users' attention could have been attracted by them. Results showed the expected opposite relationships between germane and extraneous load, a positive association between germane load and cognitive absorption and a non-linear association between intrinsic and germane load. The trends based on eye-tracking data analysis provide some interesting findings about the relationship between longer fixations, shorter saccades and cognitive load. Some issues are raised about the respective contribution of mean pupil diameter and Index of Cognitive Activity.},

This essay is based on the author's reflexive experience of researching digital media use in China, and updates Gary Alan Fine's 1993 article ``Ten Lies of Ethnography'' by identifying three lies of digital ethnography. Illustrating each of these lies through an archetypal figure -- the `networked field-weaver', the `eager participant-lurker' and the `expert fabricator' -- this article argues for the need to confront methodological illusions and embrace the tensions behind them as useful heuristics for conducting ethnographic research on, through and about digital media.},

En el IISUE nos hemos dado a la tarea de reflexionar, desde diversos campos disciplinarios e interdisciplinarios, acerca de los efectos y problemas ocasionados por la emergencia sanitaria en el campo educativo. As{\'i}, en esta obra se integran 34 trabajos que abordan la muy amplia tem{\'a}tica de la educaci{\'o}n y la universidad. Se trata de reflexiones estrechamente relacionadas con los proyectos de largo alcance del cuerpo acad{\'e}mico del IISUE y son, a la vez, ejercicios anal{\'i}ticos surgidos en el marco coyuntural de la pandemia. Interpretaciones acad{\'e}micas que, centradas en seis {\'a}mbitos tem{\'a}ticos, ofrecen una mirada general ---y sin afanes de exhaustividad--- acerca de los grandes temas educativos durante la pandemia.

  abstract = {In 1953, neurosurgeon William Beecher Scoville performed a bilateral mesial temporal lobe resection on patient Henry Molaison, who suffered from epilepsy. The operation was novel as a treatment for epilepsy and had an unexpected consequence: a severe compromise of Molaison's anterograde memory. In a landmark 1957 publication, Scoville and Milner concluded that mesial temporal lobe structures, particularly the hippocampi, were integral to the formation of new, recent memories. Over the next 5 decades, more than 100 researchers studied Molaison's memory, behavior, and learning skills, making him one of the most famous patients in the history of cognitive neuroscience. Following his death in 2008, his brain was scanned in situ and ex~vivo and then sectioned into 2401 sections. Histological evaluation of Molaison's brain further elucidated which mesial temporal lobe structures were preserved or resected in his operation, shedding new light on the neuroanatomic underpinnings of short-term memory. Scoville regretted Molaison's surgical outcome and spoke vigorously about the dangers of bilateral mesial temporal lobe surgery. This report is the first historical account of Molaison's case in the neurosurgical literature, serving as a reminder of Molaison's contributions and of the perils of bilateral mesial temporal lobe surgery.},

With practical grace and wisdom, the Manual addresses living with integrity, self-management, and personal freedom. The Manual is considered to be the pinnacle of Stoic philosophy, a school of Greek thought originating in the early third century BC, that holds that destructive emotions are the result of errors in judgement and taught an active relationship between individual will and cosmic determinism.},

  abstract = {This cross-cultural investigation of racism in the lives of black women explores everyday manifestations and perceptions of racism. The daily experiences of individuals are combined with a structured account of racism in an interdisciplinary framework. Empirical data consist of verbal accounts gathered in 1985 and 1986 in non-directive interviews with 55 black women from large cities in California and the Netherlands. Subjects from the Netherlands were largely immigrants from Surinam. The more than 2,000 concrete examples of racism provide a quantitative base from which conclusions are drawn about the two cultures. It is apparent that racism is not only problematic in its extreme manifestations but that racism permeates the social system in both countries. Black women also  experience racism as structured by notions of gender. In the Netherlands there is little historical knowledge about racism. In the United States, many women are explicitly informed by family members of the history of race relations. Denial of the existence of racism is prevalent in the Netherlands, and this denial becomes an instrument of repression in itself. In both societies, racism is an everyday experience for black women. There is a 541-item list of references. (SLD)},

I comment about the actual curricular problem of astrophysicists working in this field of investigation and the difficult communication between astrophysicists (and other scientists) and archaeologists and anthropologists. I highlight the importance of accuracy in the orientation of archaeological monuments in the site plans. Finally, I insist on the necessity of considering the celestial sphere as a part of the context of the archaeological sites, and that archaeoastronomy should be considered as a part of Landscape Archaeology. In this case, the landscape should also include the celestial context.},

  abstract = {Como dijera alguna vez Fredric Jameson, hoy parece "m{\'a}s f{\'a}cil imaginar el fin del mundo que el fin del capitalismo". Despu{\'e}s de la ca{\'i}da del muro de Berl{\'i}n, el capitalismo logr{\'o} erigirse como el {\'u}nico sistema pol{\'i}tico-econ{\'o}mico viable; una situaci{\'o}n que la crisis bancaria de 2008, lejos de poner fin, agrav{\'o}. Este libro analiza los principales rasgos y mecanismos de este realismo capitalista, como el marco ideol{\'o}gico en el cual vivimos. Utilizando ejemplos de la pol{\'i}tica, el cine, la m{\'u}sica y la literatura, Mark Fisher demuestra de qu{\'e} manera el realismo capitalista permea todas las {\'a}reas de la experiencia contempor{\'a}nea, cubriendo el horizonte de lo pensable y obturando la capacidad de imaginar un nuevo escenario cultural y sociopol{\'i}tico. El famoso eslogan de Margaret Thatcher, seg{\'u}n el cual "no hay alternativa", situ{\'o} al liberalismo econ{\'o}mico y con ello al libre comercio y la desregulaci{\'o}n del mercado como el mejor y {\'u}nico modo para organizar las sociedades modernas. "Realismo capitalista" indaga en los numerosos efectos nocivos que esta "ontolog{\'i}a de los negocios" tiene para la vida p{\'u}blica, dejando al desnudo que el capitalismo es todo menos un orden natural inevitable y eficiente. La precarizaci{\'o}n del trabajo, la intensificaci{\'o}n de la cultura del consumo, la expansi{\'o}n de la burocracia y de los mecanismos de control social, la gerencializaci{\'o}n de la pol{\'i}tica, la mercantilizaci{\'o}n de la educaci{\'o}n y el aumento de padecimientos mentales como el estr{\'e}s, la depresi{\'o}n y los des{\'o}rdenes de atenci{\'o}n se muestran bajo esta perspectiva ya no como "errores honestos" de un sistema que tiende al bien com{\'u}n, sino como dispositivos orientados a bloquear toda capacidad colectiva de transformaci{\'o}n. Ante este escenario, el {\'u}nico ant{\'i}doto posible esbozado por Fisher en los dos textos que componen el Ap{\'e}ndice y que se agregan especialmente para esta edici{\'o}n, pasa por la revitalizaci{\'o}n de una esfera p{\'u}blica que asuma las ra{\'i}ces sociales de nuestra infelicidad.},

Through four years of groundbreaking research to include data collected from the State of DevOps reports conducted with Puppet, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim set out to find a way to measure software delivery performance?and what drives it?using rigorous statistical methods. This book presents both the findings and the science behind that research, making the information accessible for readers to apply in their own organizations.

The paper considers whether the hierarchy, also known as the `Knowledge Hierarchy', is a useful and intellectually desirable construct to introduce, whether the views expressed about DIKW are true and have evidence in favour of them, and whether there are good reasons offered or sound assumptions made about DIKW. Arguments are offered that the hierarchy is unsound and methodologically undesirable. The paper identifies a central logical error that DIKW makes. The paper identifies the dated and unsatisfactory philosophical positions of operationalism and inductivism as the philosophical backdrop to the hierarchy. The paper concludes with a sketch of some positive theories, of value to information science, on the nature of the components of the hierarchy: that data is anything recordable in a semantically and pragmatically sound way, that information is what is known in other literature as `weak knowledge', that knowledge also is `weak knowledge' and that wisdom is the possession and use, if required, of wide practical knowledge, by an agent who appreciates the fallible nature of that knowledge.},

Almost without exception they have been neglecting the strong presence of public institutions of the welfare state -- despite the fact that various social security and insurance systems are such an important factor in local life. These are the offices people turn to when they are ill, require unemployment benefits, social assistance, and early retirement or disability pensions. They often provide the foundations for people to make a go of things where they live. Local communities on the other hand are not passively receiving support, but in a most intricate practice defining the actual outcome of the workings of the institutions. In this essay remuneration for illness in contemporary Sweden is used as an instrument for putting local culture in a new light. In a joint effort the macro-perspectives of political science is combined with the detailed cultural analysis of ethnology. 1 Especially the emotional aspects of community-building are brought out.},

  abstract = {{\textquestiondown}Qu{\'e} subyace al poder seductor del arte? En esta obra Alfred Gell propone una teor{\'i}a que se aparta radicalmente de las interpretaciones anteriores. Critica que las teor{\'i}as est{\'e}ticas adopten una posici{\'o}n demasiado pasiva con res-pecto de los objetos y, en cambio, hace hincapi{\'e} en el arte como forma de acci{\'o}n instrumental, concibiendo la elaboraci{\'o}n de las cosas como medio de influir en los pensamientos y actos de los dem{\'a}s. Los objetos de arte son la materializaci{\'o}n de intenciones complejas y sirven de medio para transmitir la agencia social. La conceptualizaci{\'o}n de Gell conduce a la fusi{\'o}n de los objetos de arte con las personas. El autor tambi{\'e}n analiza, entre otros temas, la psicolog{\'i}a de los patrones y la percepci{\'o}n; el arte y la personalidad; el arte en relaci{\'o}n con las pr{\'a}cticas religiosas como la posesi{\'o}n espiritual, la idolatr{\'i}a y la misa cat{\'o}lica; y el significado del arte para el artista, el visitante de galer{\'i}as y el adorador de {\'i}dolos. El detallado razonamiento de Gell -enriquecido por las diversas ilustraciones que lo acompa{\~n}an, as{\'i} como por un an{\'a}lisis del arte europeo y <<etnogr{\'a}fico>>- toca {\'a}mbitos relacionados con la filosof{\'i}a, la psicolog{\'i}a y la ling{\"u}{\'i}stica.

In The Discovery of Grounded Theory, Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss address the equally Important enterprise of how the discovery of theory from data---systematically obtained and analyzed in social research---can be furthered. The discovery of theory from data---grounded theory---is a major task confronting sociology, for such a theory fits empirical situations, and is understandable to sociologists and laymen alike. Most important, it provides relevant predictions, explanations, interpretations, and applications. In Part I of the book, "Generation Theory by Comparative Analysis," the authors present a strategy whereby sociologists can facilitate the discovery of grounded theory, both substantive and formal. This strategy involves the systematic choice and study of several comparison groups. In Part II, The Flexible Use of Data," the generation of theory from qualitative, especially documentary, and quantitative data Is considered. In Part III, "Implications of Grounded Theory," Glaser and Strauss examine the credibility of grounded theory. The Discovery of Grounded Theory is directed toward improving social scientists' capacity for generating theory that will be relevant to their research. While aimed primarily at sociologists, it will be useful to anyone Interested In studying social phenomena---political, educational, economic, industrial--- especially If their studies are based on qualitative data.},

Understanding these advances and how they relate to one another requires a deep understanding of the computational models that serve as an explanatory framework and guide ongoing experimental inquiry. This intertwining of theory and experiment now suggests very clearly that the phasic activity of the midbrain dopamine neurons provides a global mechanism for synaptic modification. These synaptic modifications, in turn, provide the mechanistic underpinning for a specific class of reinforcement learning mechanisms that now seem to underlie much of human and animal behavior. This review describes both the critical empirical findings that are at the root of this conclusion and the fantastic theoretical advances from which this conclusion is drawn.},

  abstract = {The debate on personal identity tends to conflate or ignore two different usages of the word `person'. Psychological-continuity proponents concentrate upon its use to refer to human psychology or personality, while animalist critics prefer its use to refer to individual human beings. I argue that this duality undermines any attempt to see `person' as a genuine sortal term. Instead, adopting suggestions found in Dennett and Sellars, I consider personhood as an ascription rather like an honorific title or achievement-marker. I show how the questions of identity for a regular honorific title like `genius' inevitably supervene on identity-questions concerning the more basic entity of `person'. I then argue by analogy that, if `person' be regarded as an honorific on a par with `genius', questions of personal identity over time necessarily collapse into questions of the continuing identity of human beings. Attempts to separate the continuity of a person from that of the human being who embodies it then founder on conceptual and referential incoherencies. Room is left for increasing the extension of personhood ascriptions to non-humans in the future, while much that was previously puzzling about its behaviour as a concept is explained. At least some of the revisionist debate can now be seen more profitably as a debate about the moral and pragmatic considerations underlying non-paradigm human continuity.},

Every economics textbook says the same thing: Money was invented to replace onerous and complicated barter systems--to relieve ancient people from having to haul their goods to market. The problem with this version of history? There's not a shred of evidence to support it. Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods - that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors. Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like guilt, sin, and redemption) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it"--Publisher's description},

Text as Data is organized around the core tasks in research projects using text---representation, discovery, measurement, prediction, and causal inference. The authors offer a sequential, iterative, and inductive approach to research design. Each research task is presented complete with real-world applications, example methods, and a distinct style of task-focused research. Bridging many divides---computer science and social science, the qualitative and the quantitative, and industry and academia---Text as Data is an ideal resource for anyone wanting to analyze large collections of text in an era when data is abundant and computation is cheap, but the enduring challenges of social science remain. * Overview of how to use text as data * Research design for a world of data deluge * Examples from across the social sciences and industry},

  abstract = {Leaders in the digital era are faced with breaking into new markets, disrupting existing ones, and doing so with more precision than ever before just to keep up with their competitors. To innovate more quickly, to rapidly experiment with ideas and technology, to pivot seemingly overnight, you need to have a system in place that can help you execute your most ambitious strategy. While OKRs (Objective and Key Results) have made huge waves recently, practical implementation of OKRs remains elusive for many. Lean OKRs are the evolved version of the OKR strategy execution tool that has powered the transformational journeys of giants like Google and Facebook. It is the lightweight method that turns good ideas into great execution, heightens employee engagement, aligns teams, and achieves measurable, breakthrough results. Lean OKRs presents insightful anecdotes, creative exercises, clear figures and step-by-step models. Designed as a comprehensive guide, it covers everything from theoretical roots to practical execution, including company-wide strategy alignment and emotional management. Applicable to small companies as well as large organisations, Lean OKRs drives innovation through behavioral changes, empowering and motivating teams through focused daily OKR practices that are simple to put into action. Practical and to the point, this book integrates a unique combination of structural and leadership strategies, resulting in a new approach to OKRs that conquers the hurdles experienced by most business leaders today.},

Based on ethnographic research in Guatemala, it is argued that neoliberalism's cultural project entails pro-active recognition of a minimal package of cultural rights, and an equally vigorous rejection of the rest. The result is a dichotomy between recognised and recalcitrant indigenous subjects, which confronts the indigenous rights movement as a `menace' even greater than the assimilationist policies of the previous era. It is suggested that the most effective response to this menace is probably not to engage in frontal opposition to neoliberal regimes, but rather to refuse the dichotomy altogether.},

Nevertheless, these experiences are often left out of ethnographers' "tales from the field" and remain unaddressed within qualitative literature. Harassed argues that the androcentric, racist, and colonialist epistemological foundations of ethnographic methodology contribute to silence surrounding sexual harassment and other forms of violence. The authors challenge readers to recognize how these attitudes put researchers at risk; furthers the solitude experienced by researchers; leads others to question the validity of their work; and, in turn, negatively impacts the construction of ethnographic knowledge. With the intent to improve methodological training, data collection, and knowledge produced by all researchers, Harassed advocates for an embodied approach to ethnography to reflexively engage with the ways that researchers' bodies shape the knowledge they produce. By challenging these assumptions, the authors offer an opportunity for researchers, advisors, and educators to consider the multiplicity of ways good ethnographic research can be conducted"--Provided by publisher},

The first text to offer a direct and provocative challenge to disciplinary fragmentation - arguing for the futility of segregating the study of artefacts and society - this collection expands on the concerns about the place of objects and materiality in analytical strategies, and the obligation of ethnographers to question their assumptions and approaches. The team of leading contributors put forward a positive programme for future research in this highly original and invaluable guide to recent developments in mainstream anthropological theory.},

Tras otro progreso: Filosof{\'i}a de la tecnolog{\'i}a desde la periferia (Editora Educaci{\'o}n Emergente, 2013) por H{\'e}ctor Jos{\'e} Huyke-Souffront, es un trabajo de investigaci{\'o}n acad{\'e}mico y personal que aborda de manera refrescante y original el progreso, a ra{\'i}z de una apropiaci{\'o}n alternativa de la tecnolog{\'i}a. Se realiza, entonces, un abordaje del principio de las cercan{\'i}as, entendido desde la importancia de la presencia del otro en un cara a cara, en donde se propenda tecnolog{\'i}as que posibiliten la creaci{\'o}n de lazos entre seres humanos, e igualmente, el principio del trabajo significativo, bajo la primicia de que la multiplicaci{\'o}n del trabajo creativo humano sea igual de importante que la productividad desde el punto de vista del mero potencial de consumo del ser humano. Igualmente, se realiza un abordaje conceptual en torno a la tecnolog{\'i}a, la cultura tecnol{\'o}gica, el progreso y otros conceptos claves para la compresi{\'o}n de sus postulados; es en este sentido que finaliza con la propuesta de una nueva cultura tecnol{\'o}gica y algunos cuestionamientos claves para la comunidad acad{\'e}mica en relaci{\'o}n con los procesos de cambio tecnol{\'o}gico en la educaci{\'o}n, la {\'e}tica y la pol{\'i}tica de la tecnolog{\'i}a, y la urgente interdisciplinariedad entre ciencias y humanidades.

  abstract = {[Assertions about the existence and constitution of 'nature' are not statements of fact but claims to original human potentialities, lying on the 'far side' of society. The concept of nature is thus inherently political. In reality, human beings do not dwell on the other side of a boundary between society and nature but in the same world that is inhabited by creatures of all kinds, human and non-human. Can a 'dwelling perspective', then, be combined with the recognition that human lives are lived collectively within fields of power? Is human History necessarily distinguished from the history of non-humans on the grounds that only the former involves the reproduction of power relations in the production of Society? The paper argues that there are not two kinds of history but one, comprised by the interplay of diverse human and non-human agents in their mutual relations. The infliction of pain and suffering is not limited to relations among humans. Like other creatures, humans adopt various means to protect themselves. In so doing, they create places. Ultimately, however, the protection of place and the protection of nature are incompatible. The politics of dwelling lie in this incompatibility and the struggles it entails.]},

Imagining for Real joins with a lifeworld ever in creation, attending to its formative processes, corresponding with the lives of its human and nonhuman inhabitants. Building on his two previous essay collections, The Perception of the Environment and Being Alive, this book rounds off the extraordinary intellectual project of one of the world's most renowned anthropologists. Offering hope in troubled times, these essays speak to coming generations in a language that surpasses disciplinary divisions. They will be essential reading not only to for anthropologists but also for students in fields ranging from art, aesthetics, architecture and archaeology to philosophy, psychology, human geography, comparative literature and theology"--},

Burned buildings contained rich floor assemblages, providing extraordinary information on the domestic and political lives of Classic Maya elites. Each elite residence served for a wide range of domestic work, including the storage, preparation, and consumption of food, with a relatively clear division of male and female spaces. These patterns suggest that each of the excavated elite residences was occupied by a relatively small group, which constituted an important economic and social unit. In addition, elite residences were arenas where crucial processes of the operation of the polity and court unfolded through political gatherings, artistic production, and displays of power. , El Proyecto Arqueol{\'o}gico Aguateca llev{\'o} a cabo excavaciones extensivas en residencias elitistas en el centro maya de Aguateca, el cual fue atacado por enemigos y abandonado r{\'a}pidamente a fines del per{\'i}odo Cl{\'a}sico.

  abstract = {In response to critiques from feminist, existential, and postmodern qualitative researchers, the idea of maintaining objective and distant relationships with research subjects gave way to the belief that researchers could and, in some cases, should become intimately connected to research participants. These traditions opened the door for contemporary field workers to unapologetically forge close relationships to setting members. Several ethical evaluations have emerged from this intimate literature warning researchers of the harm that can come when we ``go to far'' in the quest for intimate familiarity. In this paper, I reflect on some of the debates regarding intimacy and exploitation by examining my experiences of dating, marrying, and eventually divorcing my key informant. I trace the way that, despite my attempts to follow the existing ethical guides, I reinforced several larger inequalities in my intimate stance. Using my failure to avoid or mitigate harm, I argue that our discussions of intimate methods and immersion in the field have failed to accurately note how we reinforce or resist structure in our research endeavors. Viewing ourselves as ``doing structure'' in the field would lead us to stop debating whether intimacy is better than objectivity, celibacy is better than sex, disclosure is better than silence, or conventional behavior is better than deviance in the field. Instead, we should locate how our behaviors, research roles, or discursive choices enact structures and the effect this enactment has on the people who we research.},

F Barth, 1969) in the modern study of ethnicity. General consensus goes that this work has a status of a founding work that developed a theoretical paradigm and model of ethnic groups, on which the study of ethnicity draws until today. This study critically reviews this reputation. The author, drawing on the works of authors who had published their works before Ethnic Groups and Boundaries, suggests that theoretical positions proposed by Barth and his colleagues in the famous book were not at all new by that time, neither were they considered novel by contemporary readers. Ethnic Groups and Boundaries acquired the status of a ground-breaking work, founding a new era of anthropological study of ethnicity only later, and not because of the results the book really provided, but rather thanks to statements about the contribution of this work to the study of ethnicity made by its editor, F Barth in his famous `Introduction'. This conceptualization of the history of ethnicity studies was, thanks to the immense influence of F Barth{\textasciiacute}s book, gradually accepted and the results of all work that had been previously done in the field of ethnicity studies, was covered by amnesia, continuing until today.},

Parting from these facts, in this article we try to find out how Chinese migrants in Spain could survive in economic crisis and what is their secret of success? To this end, on the base of anthropological theoretical frame of life-mode analysis and methodology of secondary data and field work, the main objectives of this research is about the reasons why Chinese immigrants tend to be self- employed and what support them to accept long working-days.

  abstract = {The question of ethnicity is highly controversial in contemporary archaeology. Indigenous and nationalist claims to territory, often rely on reconstructions of the past based on the traditional identification of 'cultures' from archaeological remains. Sian Jones responds to the need for a reassessment of the ways in which social groups are identified in the archaeological record, with a comprehensive and critical synthesis of recent theories of ethnicity in the human sciences. In doing so, she argues for a fundamentally different view of ethnicity, as a complex dynamic form of identification, requiring radical changes in archaeological analysis and interpretation},

Germane load is considered as a learning-relevant load complementing extraneous and intrinsic load. This article argues that, in its traditional treatment, germane load is essentially indistinguishable from intrinsic load, and therefore this concept may be redundant. Contrary to extraneous and intrinsic load, germane cognitive load was added to the cognitive load framework based on theoretical considerations rather than on specific empirical results that could not be explained without this concept. The design of corresponding learning activities always required methods and techniques external to the theory. The article suggests that the dual intrinsic/extraneous framework is sufficient and non-redundant and makes boundaries of the theory transparent. The idea of germane load might have an independent role within this framework if (as recently suggested by John Sweller) it is redefined as referring to the actual working memory resources devoted to dealing with intrinsic rather than extraneous load.},

The interaction between bodies within a particular space as well as the positioning of those bodies in the space becomes manifest as visibility and/or invisibility, which are also the mechanisms through which racism is produced and sustained. While examining how space organises racial experiences, the chapter highlights the value of an embodied and spatial framework that allows for an analysis of how race is mobilised in different everyday spaces, thereby pinpointing the subtle ways that racism continues to be silently perpetuated. The state of being visible or invisible is a primary characteristic of racialised experiences and therefore should be central to discussions about racism.},

  abstract = {If there is anything that exemplifies a certain common style in ethnographically-oriented approaches to culture and society today, and sets them apart from other kinds of social science, it is the habit, irritating to colleagues in some other disciplines, frustrating to students, deemed perverse by potential funders, and bewildering to the public, of responding to explanations with the remark, ``We need to complicate the story.'' The words ``reductionist'' and ``essentializing'' are brandished with scorn. One important perspective is expressed by this remark by Jean and John Comaroff, two influential anthropologists with solid roots in longterm fieldwork, the sobriety of British social anthropology, and the tough-minded realism of the Marxist tradition: ethnography ``refuses to put its trust in techniques that give more scientific methods their illusory objectivity: their commitment to standardized, a priori units of analysis, for example, or their reliance on a depersonalizing gaze that separates subject from object'' (1992:8). These words, offered almost in passing, take a host of important arguments as settled. One is that it is no longer in much dispute that cultural anthropology is not merely at an ``immature'' stage, en route to something more akin to natural science. Most significant, perhaps, is the assumption that the separation of subject from object can be understood only in negative terms, that to say that a field of knowledge ``depersonalizes'' is ipso facto to discredit it. Yet in their own ethnographic and historical work the Comaroffs take their empirical materials very seriously and do not wholly reject the separation of subject from object---how could they? What is at issue, rather, is what kinds of ``objects'' and ``subjects,'' and what categories of analysis and comparison, are epistemologically appropriate and ethically legitimate for the study of social actions and self-understandings.},

InfoQ is different from data quality and analysis quality, but is dependent on these components and on the relationship between them. We survey statistical methods for increasing InfoQ at the study design and post-data-collection stages, and we consider them relatively to what we define as InfoQ. We propose eight dimensions that help to assess InfoQ: data resolution, data structure, data integration, temporal relevance, generalizability , chronology of data and goal , construct operationalization and communication. We demonstrate the concept of InfoQ, its components (what it is) and assessment (how it is achieved) through three case-studies in on-line auctions research. We suggest that formalizing the concept of InfoQ can help to increase the value of statistical analysis, and data mining both methodologically and practically, thus contributing to a general theory of applied statistics.},

Increasingly, however, consumers are utilizing platforms-----such as content sharing sites, blogs, social networking, and wikis-----to create, modify, share, and discuss Internet content. This represents the social media phenomenon, which can now significantly impact a firm's reputation, sales, and even survival. Yet, many executives eschew or ignore this form of media because they don't understand what it is, the various forms it can take, and how to engage with it and learn. In response, we present a framework that defines social media by using seven functional building blocks: identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. As different social media activities are defined by the extent to which they focus on some or all of these blocks, we explain the implications that each block can have for how firms should engage with social media. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations regarding how firms should develop strategies for monitoring, understanding, and responding to different social media activities.},

Viron ven{\"a}j{\"a}nkielinen v{\"a}est{\"o}, joka oli asettunut Viron alueelle neuvostovallan aikana, alettiin n{\"a}hd{\"a} muukalaisina, joiden oikeus kotiin ja kansalaisuuteen Virossa tulivat monin tavoin kyseenalaistetuiksi. T{\"a}lle Neuvostoliiton sis{\"a}isen siirtolaisuuden kautta syntyneelle ven{\"a}j{\"a}nkieliselle v{\"a}est{\"o}lle ei annettu automaattisesti Viron kansalaisuutta, heill{\"a} ei ollut oikeutta kaksoiskansalaisuuteen ja heilt{\"a} edellytettiin viron kielen taitoa, mit{\"a} suurimmalla osalla heist{\"a} ei ennest{\"a}{\"a}n ollut. T{\"a}t{\"a} politiikkaa perusteltiin sill{\"a}, ett{\"a} se oli ainoa tapa suojella Viron kansallista itsen{\"a}isyytt{\"a}, ja uuden valtion perustana t{\"a}ytyi olla ajatus etnisest{\"a} virolaisuudesta ja viron kielest{\"a}. T{\"a}m{\"a}n seurauksena ven{\"a}j{\"a}nkielinen v{\"a}est{\"o}, joka oli kotiutunut Viroon vuosikymmenten kuluessa, on kokenut, ett{\"a} heid{\"a}n kotinsa neuvostoajan j{\"a}lkeisess{\"a} Virossa on uhattuna. He ovat my{\"o}s kokeneet sosialismin kaatumista seuranneet, dramaattiset taloudelliset ja sosiaaliset muutokset, mukaan lukien Viron integrointi uusliberaalin kapitalismin rakenteisiin ja neuvostoaikaisten sosioekonomisten rakenteiden rapautuminen. N{\"a}ihin muutoksiin on liittynyt monenlaista kamppailua, ja erityisesti i{\"a}kk{\"a}{\"a}mm{\"a}t sukupolvet ovat k{\"a}rsineet my{\"o}s tunnetasolla paljon.    T{\"a}m{\"a} v{\"a}it{\"o}skirja analysoi n{\"a}it{\"a} kotiin ja kuulumiseen liittyvi{\"a} kamppailuja Viron Narvassa. Narva on Viron koillisosassa sijaitseva suhteellisen pieni teollisuuskaupunki, jossa ven{\"a}j{\"a}nkieliset muodostavat asukkaiden enemmist{\"o}n. Narvasta tuli rajakaupunki Viron itsen{\"a}istymisen yhteydess{\"a}, ja my{\"o}hemmin EU:n it{\"a}isin kaupunki. Keskityn erityisesti ven{\"a}j{\"a}nkielisen v{\"a}est{\"o}n kodin `tekemisen' k{\"a}yt{\"a}nt{\"o}ihin, joita tarkastelen sek{\"a} neuvostoaikana ett{\"a} Neuvostoliiton hajoamisen j{\"a}lkeisen{\"a} aikana. Tarkastelen ven{\"a}j{\"a}nkielisten narvalaisten arjen k{\"a}yt{\"a}nt{\"o}j{\"a} kotia koskevan antropologisen tutkimuksen valossa, ja keskityn erityisesti kodin poliittisiin ulottuvuuksiin. Ammennan erityisesti niist{\"a} teoreettisista keskusteluista, joissa k{\"a}sitteellistet{\"a}{\"a}n siirtolaisten kodin rakentamisen k{\"a}yt{\"a}nt{\"o}j{\"a} ja kotia mahdollisuuksien tilana. Tarkastelen kodin `tekemist{\"a}' materiaalisena, emotionaalisena, sosiaalisena ja poliittisena toimintana, ja ymm{\"a}rr{\"a}n sen prosessina, joka muokkautuu suhteessa valtioon, tulevaisuuden toiveisiin sek{\"a} j{\"a}lkisosialistiseen transformaatioon.    Tutkimus perustuu laajaan etnografiseen kentt{\"a}ty{\"o}h{\"o}n Narvassa vuosina 2010-- 2011 sek{\"a} lyhyen seurantajakson aikana vuonna 2018. Informanttini ovat syntyneet Viron ulkopuolella entisen Neuvostoliiton alueella, mutta muuttaneet neuvostoaikana Narvaan. Tutkimuksen p{\"a}{\"a}henkil{\"o}it{\"a} ovat siis neuvostoajan siirtolaiset, erityisesti ven{\"a}j{\"a}nkieliset i{\"a}kk{\"a}{\"a}t sukupolvet, sek{\"a} kaupunki itsess{\"a}{\"a}n. Selvitt{\"a}m{\"a}ll{\"a} ven{\"a}j{\"a}nkielisen v{\"a}est{\"o}n muuttoliikkeen historiaa neuvostoaikana, kodin `tekemisen' k{\"a}yt{\"a}nt{\"o}j{\"a} Narvassa sinne muutettaessa sek{\"a} vuosikymmenten aikana muokkautuvaa asumisen ja kodin `tekemisen' prosessia suhteessa paikkaan, paikallisyhteis{\"o}{\"o}n ja valtioon, tutkimukseni valottaa sit{\"a}, miten keskustelukumppaneideni k{\"a}sitys kodista Narvassa on muuttunut neuvostoajan j{\"a}lkeen.    Analysoin tapoja, joilla ihmiset muuntavat paikan kodiksi investoimalla siihen aikaa, energiaa ja ty{\"o}t{\"a}. En kuitenkaan tarkastele koteja ensisijaisesti henkil{\"o}kohtaisena projektina, vaan korostan sosiaalisten ja taloudellisten rakenteiden, intersubjektiivisten neuvottelujen sek{\"a} poliittisten ja taloudellisten prosessien merkityst{\"a}. Tarkastelussani koti siis ulottuu rajattujen yksityisten tilojen, kuten asuntojen ja dat{\v s}ojen, ulkopuolelle. Koti luodaan suhteessa kaupungin rytmeihin ja rutiineihin, ja osana paikallisia ja valtiollisia poliittisia projekteja. Osoitan, ett{\"a} Narvasta tuli `koti' erityisten sosiaalisten k{\"a}yt{\"a}nt{\"o}jen ja ideologisesti muovautuneiden moraalimaailmojen kautta. T{\"a}m{\"a} tutkimus valottaa sit{\"a} prosessia, jossa Narva muuttui toivon ja kehityksen paikasta ep{\"a}varmuuden ja ep{\"a}oikeudenmukaisuuden tyyssijaksi neuvostosukupolven kokemuksissa. Samalla tutkimus valottaa kodin ja kotiutumisen sosiaalisia ja poliittisia prosesseja laajemminkin, kuten my{\"o}s j{\"a}lkisosialistisen transformaation ongelmakohtia.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory has traditionally been associated with individual learning. Based on evolutionary educational psychology and our knowledge of human cognition, particularly the relations between working memory and long-term memory, the theory has been used to generate a variety of instructional effects. Though these instructional effects also influence the efficiency and effectiveness of collaborative learning, be it computer supported or face-to-face, they are often not considered either when designing collaborative learning situations/environments or researching collaborative learning. One reason for this omission is that cognitive load theory has only sporadically concerned itself with certain particulars of collaborative learning such as the concept of a collective working memory when collaborating along with issues associated with transactive activities and their concomitant costs which are inherent to collaboration. We illustrate how and why cognitive load theory, by adding these concepts, can throw light on collaborative learning and generate principles specific to the design and study of collaborative learning.},

  abstract = {Using a Peircean theory of meaning, agency may be theorized in terms of flexibility and accountability, on the one hand, and knowledge and power, on the other. In this theory, residential agency, which is closest to notions such as ``power'' and ``choice,'' is the degree to which one can control the expression of a sign, compose a sign-object relation, and commit to an interpretant of this sign-object relation. Representational agency, which is closest to notions such as ``knowledge'' and ``consciousness,'' is the degree to which one can thematize a process, characterize a feature of this theme, and reason with this theme-character relation. Agency, as a kind of social and semiotic facility, is thereby theorized as multidimensional, graduated, and distributed. This theory allows one to analyze, as concomitant phenomena, the longue dur{\'e}e processes that underlie relatively perduring institutions and the real-time practices that support relatively fleeting interactions. Finally, it highlights the theoretical and empirical terrain shared by linguistic anthropology, science and technology studies, political economy, and critical theory.},

Among the Yucatec Maya, however, one cultural value, tranquility, is enacted through bodily practices and also serves as an axis for ethnic distinction. Moreover, a specific logic associating tranquility with morality serves as an incisive critique of wealthier Others, all the more important as the Maya are incorporated into the global economy at the bottom of the class hierarchy. An understanding of ethnicity is incomplete without an ethnography of bodily practice and an investigation into how ethnic identity emerges daily in relation to embodied experiences.},

Home can be understood as a set of practices, informed by culture, that facilitates certain emotional experiences and allows individuals to express personal and collective identities in their private dwellings and beyond. Studies of home typically rely on qualitative methods and examine the making of home under challenging circumstances. Increasingly, home and belonging are investigated in relation to mobility and migration while fostering connections with other areas of study.},

We overview how generative modeling can be defined mathematically as trying to make an estimating distribution the same as an unknown ground truth distribution. This can then be quantified in terms of the value of a statistical divergence between the two distributions. We outline the maximum likelihood approach and how it can be interpreted as minimizing KL-divergence. We explore a number of approaches in the maximum likelihood family, while discussing their limitations. Finally, we explore the alternative adversarial approach which involves studying the differences between an estimating distribution and a real data distribution. We discuss how this approach can give rise to new divergences and methods that are necessary to make adversarial learning successful. We also discuss new evaluation metrics which are required by the adversarial approach.},

Primero se discute  la perspectiva naturalista del estudio de las emociones. Como se sostiene, los sentimientos y las  emociones no son sustancias transferibles ni de un individuo ni de un grupo a otro, y no son s{\'o}lo  procesos fisiol{\'o}gicos. Son relaciones, y por tanto son el producto de una construcci{\'o}n social y cultural, y se expresan en un conjunto de signos que el hombre siempre tiene la posibilidad de desplegar, incluso si no las sienten. La emoci{\'o}n es a la vez interpretaci{\'o}n, expresi{\'o}n, significaci{\'o}n, relaci{\'o}n, regulaci{\'o}n de un intercambio; se modifica de acuerdo con el p{\'u}blico, el contexto, se  diferencia en su intensidad, e incluso en sus manifestaciones, de acuerdo a la singularidad de cada  persona. Como se argumenta, el individuo a{\~n}ade su nota en un patr{\'o}n colectivo susceptible de  ser reconocido por los pares (de acuerdo con su historia personal, psicolog{\'i}a, estatus social, sexo,  edad, etc.) La afectividad es el impacto de un valor personal que se enfrenta a un contexto tal y  como es experimentado por el individuo.},

  abstract = {This dissertation traces the idea of the home and family (oikos) through several speeches from the corpus of the Attic orators. Many of the speeches are concerned with family matters, from issues of inheritance or guardianship to adultery and murder. Scholars studying the ancient Greek family often use these speeches as evidence for social practices; my dissertation differs from these approaches in that it centers around the evidence not for real life but for the ideologies that shaped the habits and opinions of the ancient Athenians. I demonstrate that the orators drew on the ideology of the oikos, a set of social expectations that the house should be well-organized and family members perfectly loyal and affectionate to one another, in order to persuade the jury to vote in their favor.The oikos was a particularly powerful symbol in the Athenian imaginary: every member of the jury and Assembly, before whom the speeches I focus on were delivered, belonged to an oikos. The orators used references to the house and family as a way of appealing to the shared experience of belonging to an oikos. In this way, they evoked what I call the home feeling, a communal, family feeling which could be used to persuade, to characterize, or to provide evidence. My first three chapters deal with forensic rhetoric, showing how speeches by Antiphon, Isocrates, Lysias, Isaeus, and Demosthenes engage with social expectations about behavior between family members and anxieties about dangers both inside and outside the house. In my fourth chapter, I argue that Demosthenes' political speeches invoke the home feeling at the level of the polis in order to persuade the people of Athens to join together against dangers at home---laziness and complacency among the citizenry---and the increasing threat of Philip of Macedon. By focusing on the home feeling and the prevalence of the rhetoric of the oikos in the Attic orators, my dissertation casts new light on the importance of the house and household in Athenian public discourse.},

Lived spaced: from local to reticular space. Notes on the social representation of lived space within globalization. In this article, I defend the need to rethink lived space. I propose increasing the complexity of the analysis of local space, based on theoretical consensus, by integrating a reticular approach to space.

Each school tries to discuss it from its own theoretical point of view, which has been controversial for hundred years. From Durkheim's social holism or social determinism to Levi Strauss's structuralism, they tried to demonstrate the priority of structure. Malinowski, who emphasizes personal needs, and Barth, who emphasizes individual actions, they stand on the point of individual initiative. The two kinds of arguments did not combine before Geertz and Bourdieu, who introduce the relationship of structure and activity into the two-way mutual construction. This article attempts to sort out the relevant theories of anthropology schools and major anthropologists on the study of structure and activity, and then to explore the changing process of the relationship},

  abstract = {"Featuring seventeen original essays on the ethics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by some of the most prominent AI scientists and academic philosophers today, this volume represents the state-of-the-art thinking in this fast-growing field and highlights some of the central themes in AI and morality such as how to build ethics into AI, how to address mass unemployment as a result of automation, how to avoiding designing AI systems that perpetuate existing biases, and how to determine whether an AI is conscious. As AI technologies progress, questions about the ethics of AI, in both the near-future and the long-term, become more pressing than ever. Should a self-driving car prioritize the lives of the passengers over the lives of pedestrians? Should we as a society develop autonomous weapon systems that are capable of identifying and attacking a target without human intervention? What happens when AIs become smarter and more capable than us? Could they have greater than human moral status? Can we prevent superintelligent AIs from harming us or causing our extinction? At a critical time in this fast-moving debate, thirty leading academics and researchers at the forefront of AI technology development come together to explore these existential questions, including Aaron James (UC Irvine), Allan Dafoe (Oxford), Andrea Loreggia (Padova), Andrew Critch (UC Berkeley), Azim Shariff (Univ. of British Columbia), Carrick Flynn (Oxford), Cathy O'Neil (O'Neil Risk Consulting \& Algorithmic Auditing), Eliezer Yudkowsky (Machine Intelligence Research Institute), Eric Schwitzgebel (UC Riverside), Frances Kamm (Rutgers), Francesca Rossi (IBM), Hanna Gunn (UC Merced), Iyad Rahwan (MIT), Jessica Taylor (Median Group), JF Bonnefon (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), K.

  abstract = {In modern states, John Lie argues, ideas of race, ethnicity, and nationality can be subsumed under the rubric of "peoplehood." He argues indeed, that the modern state has created the idea of peoplehood. That is, the seemingly primitive, atavistic feelings of belonging associated with ethnic, racial, and national identity are largely formed by the state. Not only is the state responsible for the development and nurturing of these feelings, it is also responsible for racial and ethnic conflict, even genocide. When citizens think of themselves in terms of their peoplehood identity, they will naturally locate the cause of all troubles--from neighborhood squabbles to wars--in racial, ethnic, or national attitudes and conflicts. Far from being transhistorical and transcultural phenomena, race, ethnicity, and nation, Lie argues, are modern notions--modernity here associated with the rise of the modern state, the industrial economy, and Enlightenment ideas.},

Thus, the paper articulates analytically the results of various studies on the subject and shows that while Mayan ethnicity in Yucat{\'a}n has a common basis ---the ethnic actors identify themselves as Maya, recognizing themselves as heirs of the Pre-Hispanic Maya and distinguish themselves from nonindigenous--- also has various political, economic and legal expressions with different scopes. This paper offers theoretical elements to understand the emergence of Mayan ethnicity and its various expressions. It also identifies recent expressions of Mayan ethnicity, such as those related to the impact of social sciences and business foundations, which have not yet been fully analyzed and are presented as routes to explore.},

Toma como punto de partida acciones de escrache hacia varones cis como enclave del an{\'a}lisis de sus testimonios para dar cuenta de los m{\'u}ltiples espacio-tiempos que fuimos precisando durante la investigaci{\'o}n, a fin de dar materialidad a una epistemolog{\'i}a de las coaliciones; en la que la traducci{\'o}n, la narrativa ficcionada y el pensar en conversaci{\'o}n una junta a les otres, resultaron los dispositivos centrales. Metodolog{\'i}a: como eje de esta metodolog{\'i}a, las narrativas ficcionadas, a partir de testimonios propiciaron conversaciones, discusiones, debates, coaliciones y difractaron una elaboraci{\'o}n colectiva de materiales que habilita a pensar estrategias pedag{\'o}gicas en clave feminista. Algunas de las preguntas de indagaci{\'o}n que atraviesan y se traman en este escrito refieren a: {\textquestiondown}cu{\'a}l ha sido la renovaci{\'o}n metodol{\'o}gica que propician los feminismos del sur?, {\textquestiondown}qu{\'e} tensiones, conflictos, emergencias, cegueras y sorderas epistemol{\'o}gicas visibilizan los feminismos del sur?, {\textquestiondown}en qu{\'e} medida el desplazamiento sujeto-objeto a sujeta-sujetxs propicia otras formas de producci{\'o}n de conocimiento?, {\textquestiondown}cu{\'a}les riesgos corremos si incluimos a nuevas masculinidades como informantes para pensar los escraches?, {\textquestiondown}cu{\'a}les son las variaciones que habilita la narrativa ficcionada?, {\textquestiondown}por qu{\'e} su potencia productiva nos corre de la representaci{\'o}n a la difracci{\'o}n?, {\textquestiondown}en qu{\'e} momento asumimos una pedagog{\'i}a del deseo como anclaje creativo?, {\textquestiondown}por qu{\'e} esa pedagog{\'i}a desbordar{\'i}a los canales conocidos de toda pedagog{\'i}a posible?, {\textquestiondown}c{\'o}mo esas difracciones posibilitar{\'i}an una epistemolog{\'i}a de las coaliciones?

  abstract = {This project contributes to anthropologies of the state, (diasporic return) migration, belonging, home, and conflict, including genocide and war. It intervenes in the anthropology of home by focusing on both the social and physical aspects of home, its pain, joys, and ironies, and it speaks to the anthropology of genocide by showing how a population a century removed from a genocide uses it to interpret their experience. This dissertation also deals with state constructions of ideal citizen formation--one of obligation and devotion to the socially constructed ancestral homeland, where descendants who share an ethnic identity have a role to play to strengthen the state, as well as the perceived obligation of ancestral states to diasporic populations. I refer to states who use ``pull'' dynamics, such as repatriation campaigns, as ``beckoning states.'' This dissertation is about a conflict between state discourses of repatriation and collective memory of the Armenian genocide in the socially and physically constructed homeland, the Republic of Armenia, and individual memories of a nostalgically constructed home in Syria from which Syrian Armenian women were forced to flee during the Syrian conflict. My primary argument is that state constructions of home and belonging which rely on collective memory of the Armenian genocide, collide with Syrian Armenian women's individual memories of an experiential home crafted in Syria over the course of five generations since the Armenian genocide. Since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, approximately 20,000 Syrian citizens of ethnic Armenian descent fled to Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, enticed by the host state with promises of citizenship. Interested potential citizens must provide ``proof'' of Armenian ethnicity. Despite its small population size, compared to other countries to which Syrian refuge-seekers have fled, Armenia has become one of the highest receiving countries of Syrian refuge-seekers per capita. However, long-term integration of refuge-seekers by the host Armenian community raises compelling issues about exclusion and inclusion. Roughly one hundred years after the Armenian genocide, Syrian Armenian women fleeing Syria traveled similar paths through historic Western Armenia (now eastern and southeastern Turkey) as their ancestors once had during the genocide, albeit in reverse (Syria through Turkey to Armenia in 2012-2016; Western Armenia/present-day Turkey to Syria in 1915-1922). Decisions to select certain legal statuses are moralized by some members of the host community-- ``good'' Syrian Armenians are those who stay and socially, and more importantly economically, contribute to the socially constructed homeland, the Republic of Armenia. ``Good'' Syrian Armenians become citizens. ``Bad'' Syrian Armenians are moralized as those who leave after a short period in Armenia and are perceived as taking advantage of Armenia's benefits for refugees. A secondary home was constructed over five generations of descendants of Armenian genocide survivors who had fled to Syria. The term ``ironic home'' refers to the fact that Syria was simultaneously a site of refuge for genocide survivors and immense trauma, where many Armenians were forcibly displaced and killed. The Armenian state's instrumentalization of memories of the 1915 Armenian genocide to create new ethnic Armenian citizens through calls for repatriation and nation-building conflicts with many interlocutors' nostalgia for Syria. State narratives specifically targeted Syrian Armenian migrant women in Armenia, depicting them as potential citizens and contributing members of society through an emphasis on their economic contributions to the state. The theme of preferential citizens-to-be is further encapsulated by what has been referred to by one interlocutor as the Syrian Armenian ``brand.'' This refers to state efforts and humanitarian marketing referencing Syrian Armenian migrants in Armenia. While not an official legal category used to refer to refuge-seekers in Armenia, the Syrian Armenian ``brand'' nonetheless helps to explain why certain barriers to socioeconomic integration exist for Syrian Armenian migrant women in Armenia. Gender dynamics, specifically gendered participation in the paid labor force, have changed significantly among ethnic Armenian women from Syria after migration to Armenia. Middle to upper class ethnic Armenian women in Syria were generally able to rely on their spouse's salary to provide for the family, as well as for entertainment purposes and did not have to work. Some women ran their own businesses in Syria or occupied high-status jobs, such as doctors and pharmacists. In Armenia, however, Syrian Armenian women are compelled to work to help support their families. Many Syrian Armenian migrant women were shocked and disappointed that it was challenging to find work in Armenia. They were looking forward to promises of security, which they were mostly granted in Armenia. In Syria, there was the threat of disruptions to physical security, but there was a sense of socioeconomic protection. In Armenia, most women I interviewed felt that they were physically safer but were more insecure financially and did not have a strong social network outside of the Syrian Armenian community in Yerevan. This dissertation is about collective and individual memories, nostalgia, manipulative statecraft, and various actors--migrant women, state and non-state employees, Syria and Armenia. My research focuses on paradoxes, layers (history, actors, data), and the messiness of states and NGOs as it relates to the integration of migrant women within a host community/socially constructed homeland.},

In this article, I examine a case where there is very little mobilization and organization around ethnic identity: Yucat{\'a}n, Mexico. I begin with a political history of Yucat{\'a}n, comparing it with and contrasting it to Chiapas. I then argue that ethnic mobilization in Yucat{\'a}n is significantly limited for two main reasons: first, Maya peasants had so little relative autonomy under the corporatist regime (1940s--1980s) and official peasant leagues that they were constrained in using the experience garnered in these leagues for subsequent ethnic-based organization; and second, the social organizations and networks that provide activists and potential activists with the capacity to mobilize -- namely, peasant leagues and the progressive Catholic Church -- have not served as vehicles for leadership training and organization in Yucat{\'a}n.},

Compared to the rest of Mexico and to Yucat{\'a}n's historical patterns, the growth in the out-of-state population during this time period has been unusual and dramatic. We focus on one explanation for this growth: the increase in criminal violence and insecurity in the rest of Mexico that has made Yucat{\'a}n an attractive destination for Mexicans seeking safe spaces to work, raise their families, and retire. Migration-policy specialists, the media, and scholars often focus their attention on Internally Displaced Peoples (IDPs), who are forcibly displaced from their homes in contexts of generalized violence. Although migrants to Yucat{\'a}n cite security concerns more than migrants to any other state, few come from states in which IDPs have been documented. We broadly define migrants seeking safety from criminal insecurity and violence as security migrants and argue that using this broader definition describes migrants to Yucat{\'a}n more accurately than IDPs.},

We challenge this scepticism by considering two theoretical objections: there is no such thing as ethnicity and ethnic categories are unable to explain social processes; and by showing how ethnic strategies affect outcomes that cannot be captured in standard ethnic penalty analyses, we offer a new way to examine ethnic penalties in unemployment. We calculate a set of net ethnic penalties and then analyse longitudinal labour-force data to examine how strategies such as self-employment change ethnic penalties in unemployment amongst six different ethnic groups in Britain. The results show that self-employment reduces the ethnic penalty for Indians, Pakistanis-Bangladeshis and others, but not for Blacks, White-Others and White-British. This supports the argument that ethnicity can provide an explanation for some of the ethnic differentials in the labour market.},

A building block of normative economics and social choice theory, and often borrowed by contemporary political philosophy, the principle has rarely been subjected to philosophical criticism. The paper objects to it on the ground that it applies indifferently to those cases in which the individuals agree both on their expressed preferences and on their reasons for entertaining them, and those cases in which they agree on their expressed preferences while differing on their reasons. The latter are cases of `spurious unanimity', and it is normatively inappropriate, or so the paper argues, to defend unanimity preservation at the social level for such cases: thus the Pareto principle is formulated much too broadly. The objection seems especially powerful when the principle is applied in an ex ante context of uncertainty, in which individuals can disagree on both their probabilities and utilities, and nonetheless agree on their preferences over prospects.},

El despliegue de la llamada ``revoluci{\'o}n digital'' parece avizorar una tendencia al desvanecimiento de la divisi{\'o}n entre el mundo f{\'i}sico y el mundo de la informaci{\'o}n. Si bien en el pasado una red de fabricaci{\'o}n, distribuci{\'o}n y comercializaci{\'o}n a escala industrial llevaba los productos a manos del consumidor, hoy en d{\'i}a, con la maduraci{\'o}n de la impresi{\'o}n 3D, las computadoras tienen el potencial de reproducir productos directamente desde archivos digitales. Este fen{\'o}meno se inscribe en la llamada ``democratizaci{\'o}n de las herramientas de dise{\~n}o y fabricaci{\'o}n'', configurando al ``movimiento Maker'' en una de sus expresiones culturales m{\'a}s interesantes, bajo el lema de ``h{\'a}galo usted mismo''. El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar el surgimiento del movimiento Maker, describir los conceptos que definen la esencia del movimiento, as{\'i} como explorar los desaf{\'i}os que conllevan estos cambios en la generaci{\'o}n, transferencia y uso del conocimiento.

Con la ciudad de fondo, tiempo, espacio y personas se imbrican en una transformaci{\'o}n continua. Siguiendo esta estela, el presente art{\'i}culo hace una aportaci{\'o}n te{\'o}rica al conectar territorio, ciudad y espacio p{\'u}blico para ahondar en el conocimiento de {\'e}ste {\'u}ltimo. Para ello recorremos tres escalas distintas: partimos de la instrumentalizaci{\'o}n global del territorio en pos de la acumulaci{\'o}n, la fragmentaci{\'o}n de la ciudad y la disoluci{\'o}n de la identidad urbana y, finalmente, las presiones sobre el espacio p{\'u}blico. La organizaci{\'o}n instrumental del territorio en centros y periferias transforma las ciudades en complejos palimpsestos sociales, y su espacio p{\'u}blico, el lugar de encuentro democr{\'a}tico entre an{\'o}nimos, en lugares donde la individualidad peligra. {\textquestiondown}Existe una r{\'e}plica desde la microescala?

From the analysis of genetic information, these studies construct genealogies that connect body characteristics with geographies and stories of origin. In recent years, an international group of researchers worked in a project focused on Latin American populations. In this paper, we present the results of our ethnographic work and interviews with participants in this project. Based on this material, we show that Mexican participants tend to use their physical appearance, typological ideas of human difference, family stories and family names to give meaning to scientific terms such as genetic ancestry. Participants rely on shared visual habits to interpret their own and others' appearance and to negotiate their belonging to racial, ethnic and family groups. (English)}

The data is based on open-end, in-depth interviews with twenty-one M{\=a}ori Jews between the ages of eighteen and sixty-seven years old, highlighting relationship with whakapapa through funerary practices and food. It demonstrates that contemporary M{\=a}ori Jews express longing for home and intimacy as well as ambivalence, pain and grief as they critique home. In their lived relationships with whakapapa the M{\=a}ori Jews in this study employ defiant memory to resist the intergenerational racial tension within their wh{\=a}nau. In this way, they constitute their infrastructure of intimacy and ameliorate their well-being.},

  abstract = {The vacant retirement house has become a central feature of many areas of the Global South. Over the years, migrants' savings are invested in the building of conspicuous houses for retirement in their areas of origin. But despite these substantial efforts, a number of migrants postpone their return or do not return at all. Their houses remain empty, their purposes shifting as their owners reach old age. This stretching of time does not only affect the migrants' livelihoods and ideas of home. Furthermore, kin-scripts as conceptualized by Stack and Burton (1993) are being reconfigured substantially. This goes hand-in-hand with the reframing of culturally prescribed responsibilities, meanings, and social roles attached to certain stages of the migrants' lives. Based on long-term and multi-local ethnographic fieldwork in rural Mexico and urban Chicago since the 1990s, we analyze how remittance houses are tied and untied with their owners' life courses in the later stages of life. Furthermore, we examine how kin groups on both sides of the border deal with the new challenges this entails.},

  abstract = {In the 2010 University of Valencia Chancellor elections four professors, a number unusually high, presented their candidatures to direct the institution. Taking advantage of the options that the actual technology offers, for the first time in Spain, it is performed a prospective study of an electoral process in an academic institution. This work has tried to test three forecasting procedures (a Delphi panel of experts, an on-line survey to professors and an information market) in order to reduce the uncertainty of the process, to bring information to the people of the university and to compare the goodness-of-the-fit of the forecasting approaches. This paper describes the experience, shows results and warns about the difficulties and resistances that a project of this kind could find. Regarding the obtained outcomes, the survey forecasts have been considerably more accurate than the opinions of the experts, although, as it happens in almost all the electoral surveys, our survey has also suffered of non-response bias. Unfortunately, the information market, a tool that is already being successfully used to predict electoral results in the US, was restrained and cannot be investigated.},

(Ever had a Fuse bar? Yeah, neither have we.)  Good copywriting burns into your brain, seeps into your guts. And in this episode, you're going to learn how to write it.  Harry and David get down-and-dirty with the most important principles of copywriting. You'll learn ``The Three Rules'' of good copy. You'll compare ads that worked with ads that didn't.

  abstract = {Hong Kong is an Asian metropolis with a population of approximately seven million. Previous studies on the region concentrate on its history that is marked by radical changes to conclude that the on-going makeovers in the physical environment leave people without a permanence of place. Researchers also say that this fluid history eradicates temporal identity because premodernism and post-modernism exist at the same time. This study investigates how to describe and explain the relationship between people and environment in Hong Kong. Six informants who are from Hong Kong and who live in Hong Kong help to portray an image of home that does not agree with earlier studies. By looking at physical and emotional boundaries, expressions, and temporal dimensions, this study shows that people cannot be separated from their environment as both parts constitute the unity of being home. This study therefore concludes that neither the sense of place nor the temporal identity is threatened by the region's history of instability. Rather, the informants express a strong sense of home because of the fast pace of life in Hong Kong.},

Hence, the need to write clear and accurate use case descriptions has a significant impact for many practitioners. However, many have pointed to weaknesses in the support offered to those writing use cases, and a number of authors advocate the use of rules in the composition and structuring of use case descriptions. These rules constrain the user, by only allowing certain grammatical constructions, typically guiding the structure or the style of the description For example, the CREWS research project pioneered Use Case Authoring Guidelines, suggesting that the adoption of such guidelines improved resulting use case descriptions. Replication of CREWS studies appeared to confirm the view that use case descriptions were improved through the application of guideline sets, but also noted that learning such rules presented a significant overhead. Hence, a leaner set of guidelines (the CP rules) was developed.},

First, I discuss how visual ethnographic research might appreciate the sensory nature of experience. Seeing the home as both the context and subject of field work, 1 shall introduce the idea of the 'sensory home'. This refers to the home as a domain composed of different sensory elements (smell, touch, taste, vision, sound) that is simultaneously understood and created through the sensory experience and manipulation of these elements. I then explore how such visual and sensory research might best be represented as text that is conversant with mainstream anthropology. I shall suggest that while film and writing have both tackled this theme, hypermedia offers new possibilities that might bridge the gap between written and visual anthropology.},

In this article, I face the task of showing my own political and pedagogical practices in regards to intersectionality, presenting some of the most frequent questions that emerge. It is also relevant that intersectionality is not just about describing the diversity of citizens, but rather, evidence that some citizens live experiences that can be labeled as `abject', `belonging to the margins' or `dissident'. At the same time, intersectionality implies the existence of some privileges, as well as agency and empowerment.},

When given sufficient amounts of capacity, training data, and compute time, the representations learned by these models include disentangled features corresponding to high-level concepts. Specifically, we find a single unit which performs sentiment analysis. These representations, learned in an unsupervised manner, achieve state of the art on the binary subset of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. They are also very data efficient. When using only a handful of labeled examples, our approach matches the performance of strong baselines trained on full datasets. We also demonstrate the sentiment unit has a direct influence on the generative process of the model. Simply fixing its value to be positive or negative generates samples with the corresponding positive or negative sentiment.},

La conceptualizaci{\'o}n tradicional de espacio alude a la concepci{\'o}n positivista del espacio abstracto, la cual se transforma en el contexto de la globalizaci{\'o}n que viene acompa{\~n}ada de una transici{\'o}n epistemol{\'o}gica. Es aqu{\'i} donde el ``giro espacial'' plantea una nueva interpretaci{\'o}n de la espacialidad urbana desde una perspectiva interdisciplinaria que integra las dimensiones materiales e inmateriales del espacio y las formas en que estos devienen en lugares. La construcci{\'o}n del lugar est{\'a} elaborada a partir de las pr{\'a}cticas socio-espaciales y la subjetividad espacial; las primeras remiten a las formas de habitar la ciudad de acuerdo a las actividades cotidianas y la segunda est{\'a} entendida en t{\'e}rminos sociales y los sentimientos hacia el entorno en di{\'a}logo entre el lugar y los actores sociales.},

Frente a los reduccionismos del primordialismo cultural y, tambi{\'e}n, de ciertas versiones encasilladas en la teor{\'i}a constructivista, como los enfoques instrumentalistas radicales de la identidad {\'e}tnica, se incide en la necesidad de considerar a la etnicidad como un fen{\'o}meno dual: como una combinaci{\'o}n en muchos aspectos {\'u}nica entre inter{\'e}s y adhesi{\'o}n primaria o afectiva, lo que dota a las asociaciones {\'e}tnicas de una notable superioridad frente a otras formas de asociaci{\'o}n colectiva como n{\'u}cleo de movilizaci{\'o}n social. /// This article presents and assesses the major contributions made by some of the studies carried out on the ethnic character and ethnic relationships during particular recent decades, as compared with the predictions of different variants of contemporary sociological theory, through a significant intensification of articulated social conflicts over ethnic loyalties and dividing lines. The advances made are stated and some of the lacunae and abuses that have dominated the debate between primordialist and constructivist views of the ethnic character are identified. As contrasted with reductionisms of cultural primordialism and, besides, certain versions that are typecast in constructivist theory, such as radical instrumentalist approaches to the ethnic identity, the subject of the need to consider the ethnic character as a dual phenomen is touched on: as a combination which in many aspects is unique between interest and primary or affective adherence, which provides ethnic associations with a significant degree of superiority as against other forms of collective association as a nucleus of social mobilization.},

Artification, a new concept and practice, encourages us texperience various aspects of our lives normally not associated with art or aesthetics, such as business, education, and medical practice, from an artistic viewpoint. Both discourses are helpful in sharpening our aesthetic sensibility and enriching our aesthetic life. However, precisely because the aesthetic dimension of our lives exerts a considerable power in shaping our lives and the world, we need to cultivate aesthetic literacy and a vigilant attitude toward the use of this power. I argue against the indiscriminate and uncritical adoption of artification by exploring the ways in which the artification strategy can undermine the intended purpose and the value of art in a workaday environment and organizational practice.},

  abstract = {In the history of Western aesthetics, the subject matters thatreceived attention ranged from natural objects and phenomena, builtstructures, utilitarian objects, and human actions, to what is todayregarded as the fine arts. However, beginning with the nineteenthcentury, the discourse has become increasingly focused on the finearts. This narrowing attention occurred despite the prominence of theaesthetic attitude theory in modern aesthetics, according to whichthere is virtually no limit to what can become a source of aestheticexperience. The tendency to equate aesthetics with the philosophy ofart became widespread in twentieth century aesthetics, particularlywithin the Anglo-American tradition., Challenges to this rather limited scope of aesthetics began during thelatter half of the twentieth century with a renewed interest in natureand environment, followed by the exploration of popular arts. Everydayaesthetics continues this trajectory of widening scope by includingobjects, events, and activities that constitute people's dailylife. However, it is more accurate to characterize this recentdevelopment as restoring the scope of aesthetics rather thanopening a new arena., In addition, many cultural traditions outside the Western sphere havelong been concerned with the aesthetics of daily life. In somecultural traditions, such as Inuit and Navajo, aestheticconsiderations are thoroughly integrated in daily activities,including making things such as tools (Papanek 1995; Witherspoon1996). Even in other traditions, such as Japanese and Chinese, withdistinctive art-making practices of paintings, literature, theater,and the like, aesthetic practices permeate people's daily life.One of the findings of comparative aesthetics is that a greateremphasis is placed on the aesthetics of everyday life in manynon-Western cultures than in the West (Higgins 2005)., Thus, the perception that everyday aesthetics is a new frontier ofaesthetics discourse needs to be situated in the context of latetwentieth-century Anglo-American aesthetics. That is, it wasestablished as a reaction against what was considered to be an unduerestriction on the scope of aesthetics. It aims to give due regard tothe entirety of people's multi-faceted aesthetic life, includingvarious ingredients of everyday life: artifacts of daily use, choresaround the house, interactions with other people, and quotidianactivities such as eating, walking, and bathing. Everyday aestheticsalso seeks to liberate aesthetic inquiry from an almost exclusivefocus on beauty (and to a certain extent sublimity) characteristic ofmodern Western aesthetics. It includes within its purview thosequalities that pervade everyday experience, such as pretty, cute,messy, gaudy, tasteful, dirty, lively, monotonous, to name only a few.These items and qualities are characterized by their ubiquitouspresence in the daily life of people, regardless of their identity,occupation, lifestyle, economic status, social class, culturalbackground, and familiarity with art., Beyond attending to more items and qualities for its inquiry, everydayaesthetics also raises theoretical issues that have not receivedadequate attention from the prevailing mainstream Western aesthetics.These include: indeterminate identity of the object of aestheticexperience due to a lack of an institutionally agreed-upon framing;changes and modifications everyday objects go through; generalanonymity of the designer and creator, as well as absence of any clearauthorship behind everyday objects; bodily engagements with objectsand activities and their pragmatic outcome; perceived lack of criteriafor aesthetic judgments. By raising these issues, everyday aestheticschallenges long-held assumptions underlying art-centered aestheticsdiscourse. However, everyday aesthetics advocates pose thesechallenges not as a way of invalidating the established aestheticsdiscourse. Rather, they are meant to shed new light on the prevailingdiscourse. Just as new forms of art often introduce qualities andvalues that were not considered before and enrich the artworld, assuggested by Arthur Danto, everyday aesthetics proposes to helpdevelop the overall aesthetics discourse by adding new avenues ofinquiry. Accordingly, the account of everyday aesthetics that followswill focus on these issues that have been raised to illuminate andchallenge the prevailing aesthetics discourse in contemporary Westernphilosophy.},

  abstract = {If asked to imagine home, most of us will come to think of a particular house or building. And, for many of us, the quintessential image of home remains the place we grew up in. This close association between house and home has long marked anthropological literature. And yet, when we imagine home, it is often not the structures themselves but the feelings, practices, and relationships within familiar spaces which give home a powerful sense of belonging. Home may be the scent of a grandmother's cooking, the familiar fuzz of a worn cushion, the seemingly defiant thrill of hanging posters on the wall as a teenager, or the knot of tension in the stomach of a child listening to an argument in the adjoining room. Recent anthropological studies have hence looked beyond physical structures to understand home in terms of a diverse array of practices, meaningful and imaginative forms, and feelings which surround a sense of groundedness within the world. Understood in such terms, home becomes something much less solid than a structure of stone or wood. It tends to be contestable and fragile, a domain not only of belonging but also of potential alienation when attempts to make home fail or are subverted. This flourishing literature increasingly suggests that while physical shelter may be a basic existential need, it is houses and homes, wrapped up in the desire and struggle for belonging, which underpin human sociality.},

  abstract = {For the Mayans, the subjectivation of things is essential in their philosophy of inhabiting the territory, where they are all subjects; therefore, their vernacular architecture also assumes this perception on bringing the house to life. To arrive at this precept, a research project was developed that sought to understand the processes of transferring knowledge to tie (build) their vernacular architecture, in a study that involved methodologies of both the area of architecture and anthropology. While surveying architectural data, this process of life of the Mayan houses was noticed, which, on mainly being made from short-lasting materials, have a given lifespan but, at the same time, new houses are being tied, that will come alive when they are inhabited by new families. This makes the vernacular architecture of the Mayans ephemeral. The knowledge to tie-up has also been used to create another much more ephemeral architecture: The ``tablados'' (bullrings) for bullfights. On these ``tablados'' being linked to the patron saint, they only exist for one week, forming an ephemeral cultural landscape typical of the Mayan populations of the Yucatan Peninsula. This ephemeral quality is an essential characteristic of the Mayan vernacular architecture, but they are also a vital part of their existence on being the scenarios to learn about construction.},

Primero fija el lugar parad{\'o}jico y excepcional del pueblo como soporte de legitimidad de una modernidad que se afirma en la exclusi{\'o}n del pueblo como constituyente, ello nos permite separar dos conceptos de pueblo cruciales en la modernidad e identificar que el aut{\'e}ntico pueblo de la democracia es el pueblo ``oculto'', ``la nuda vida'' que el derecho, al suplantar la soberan{\'i}a popular, suspende en estado de excepci{\'o}n permanente. Luego rescata el concepto de pueblo, a partir del principio de su ``potencia'' para lograr la s{\'i}ntesis entre poder constituyente y soberano que ha sido prohibida por el derecho moderno. La tercera fase establece que cualquier filosof{\'i}a pol{\'i}tica o constitucional que no tenga su punto de partida en la simbiosis entre modernidad y colonialidad es superficial, vac{\'i}a y esta decididamente del lado de los m{\'e}todos de opresi{\'o}n y supresi{\'o}n pol{\'i}tica. Luego demuestra que en Am{\'e}rica Latina la categor{\'i}a ``Naci{\'o}n'' ha obrado como un agente de exclusi{\'o}n social y pol{\'i}tica por excelencia, y que en vez de haber sido una herramienta de emancipaci{\'o}n y resistencia lo ha sido de dominaci{\'o}n y destrucci{\'o}n de la diferencia, es en la Naci{\'o}n entonces donde hay que ubicar la transformaci{\'o}n de un proyecto colonialista a un proyecto de colonialidad. Finalmente, y luego de abordar la democracia desde la diferencia entre violencia que crea el derecho y la que la conserva, de entender la soberan{\'i}a no desde el poder constituido sino del constituyente y de separar el ``principio del orden'' del ``orden concreto'' llegaremos a la conclusi{\'o}n que dado que el orden de la democracia es el conflicto, la democracia es la anulaci{\'o}n de las condiciones para gobernar y por ende es la {\'u}nica y aut{\'e}ntica forma de lo pol{\'i}tico.},

The philosophy of action provides us with a standardconception and a standard theory of action. The former construesaction in terms of intentionality, the latter explains theintentionality of action in terms of causation by the agent'smental states and events. From this, we obtain a standard conceptionand a standard theory of agency. There are alternative conceptions ofagency, and it has been argued that the standard theory fails tocapture agency (or distinctively human agency). Further, it seems thatgenuine agency can be exhibited by beings that are not capable ofintentional action, and it has been argued that agency can and shouldbe explained without reference to causally efficacious mental statesand events., Debates about the nature of agency have flourished over the pastfew decades in philosophy and in other areas of research (includingpsychology, cognitive neuroscience, social science, andanthropology). In philosophy, the nature of agency is an importantissue in the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of psychology, thedebates on free will and moral responsibility, in ethics, meta-ethics,and in the debates on the nature of reasons and practicalrationality. For the most part, this entry focuses on conceptual andmetaphysical questions concerning the nature of agency. In the finalsections, it provides an overview of empirically informed accounts ofthe sense of agency and of various empirical challenges to thecommonsense assumption that our reasons and our conscious intentionsmake a real difference to how we act.},

  abstract = {This investigation confirms the existence of a home advantage in organized sports; however, it refines and extends that knowledge in a number of ways. The home advantage is most pronounced in the indoor sports of ice hockey and basketball; least so, in the outdoor sports of baseball and football. More effective offensive rather than defensive action is the major factor in the home advantage among all sports. Playing at home or away from home is as strong a correlate of a team's performance as is the average quality of its players. Finally, inferences from the data, as well as more direct observations on audience size and its relationship to performance and outcome, justify the conclusion that the home advantage is almost totally independent of visitor fatigue and lack of familiarity with the home playing area; it is mainly attributable to the social support of the home audience.},

  abstract = {An account of all the new and surprising evidence now available for the beginnings of the earliest civilizations that contradict the standard narrative. Why did humans abandon hunting and gathering for sedentary communities dependent on livestock and cereal grains, and governed by precursors of today's states? Most people believe that plant and animal domestication allowed humans, finally, to settle down and form agricultural villages, towns, and states, which made possible civilization, law, public order, and a presumably secure way of living. But archaeological and historical evidence challenges this narrative. The first agrarian states, says James C. Scott, were born of accumulations of domestications: first fire, then plants, livestock, subjects of the state, captives, and finally women in the patriarchal family-all of which can be viewed as a way of gaining control over reproduction. Scott explores why we avoided sedentism and plow agriculture, the advantages of mobile subsistence, the unforeseeable disease epidemics arising from crowding plants, animals, and grain, and why all early states are based on millets and cereal grains and unfree labor. He also discusses the "barbarians" who long evaded state control, as a way of understanding continuing tension between states and nonsubject peoples},

  abstract = {This article reflects on the contributions of the late John Urry to sociology and to its spatial turn especially by developing the new mobilities paradigm. The proposition of this monograph issue of Current Sociology is that space has not yet been appropriately incorporated into sociology. But although partially true, Urry argued that this misses the significance of ?the mobilities turn? that swept through and incorporated the spatial turn within sociology but also within other disciplines. Tracing the spatial turn back to the 1980s, the article describes how the new mobilities paradigm grew out of and extended emerging theorizations of space. It argues that Urry?s work advanced a sociology of space though his focus on mobile spatializations and relational space. This included the distribution of agency between people, places, and material assemblages of connectivity; a broader shift in the spatial imagination of mobilities towards ?non-representational? social theory; the emergence of new methodologies that were more eclectic, experimental, creative, and linked to arts, design, and public policy; and lastly a renewed interest in geo-ecologies, the political economy of resource flows, and the global mobilities of energy, capital, and material objects as constitutive of spatial complexity. The new mobilities paradigm furthered the spatial turn in social sciences in many crucial ways, and John Urry?s body of work on mobilities and its influence on countless adjacent research areas have spread that spatial thinking far and wide.},

Furthermore, we critically review recent research concerning the effectiveness of embodiment interventions and develop a taxonomy to more properly characterize research on embodied cognition. The main dimensions of this taxonomy are bodily engagement (i.e. how much bodily activity is involved) and task integration (i.e. whether bodily activities are related to a learning task in a meaningful way or not). By locating studies on the 2 {\texttimes} 2 grid resulting from this taxonomy and assessing the corresponding learning outcomes, we identify opportunities, problems, and challenges of research on embodied learning.},

  year = {2003},
  series = {Contemporary Political Theory},

  abstract = {How is a sense of belonging to a political community created? Rogers Smith suggests that Stories of Peoplehood, narratives which include racial, religious, ethnic and cultural elements, serve to make membership of a political group part of an individual's identity. He argues that competition over accounts of a nation's history and culture is thus an important part of political life. Examples from around the world since the 18th century are included. In particular, Smith traces the history of competing conceptions of national identity and citizenship in the United States from the revolution to the present day, showing the tension between liberal and egalitarian ideals, and traditions of racism and chauvinism. Combining theory with rich historical detail, Smith's book is an original and provocative account of how national identity is forged. Rogers M. Smith is the Christopher H. Browne Distinguished Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Smith centers his research on contitutional law, American political thought, and modern legal and political theory, with special interests in questions of citizenship, race, ethnicity and gender. His previous books include, Civic Ideals: Conflicting Visions of Citizenship in U.S. History (Yale, 1997) and Liberalism and American Constitutional Law (Harvard, 1985).},

Over time, he has developed the concept of ``political peoples,'' a category that is much broader and more fluid than legal citizenship, enabling Smith to offer rich new analyses of political communities, governing institutions, public policies, and moral debates. This book gathers Smith's most important writings on peoplehood to build a coherent theoretical and historical account of what peoplehood has meant in American political life, informed by frequent comparisons to other political societies. From the revolutionary-era adoption of individual rights rhetoric to today's battles over the place of immigrants in a rapidly diversifying American society, Smith shows how modern America's growing embrace of overlapping identities is in tension with the providentialism and exceptionalism that continue to make up so much of what many believe it means to be an American. A major work that brings a lifetime of thought to bear on questions that are as urgent now as they have ever been, Political Peoplehood will be essential reading for social scientists, political philosophers, policy analysts, and historians alike.},

  abstract = {With the advent and accessibility of the Internet, artistic and indigenous communities are beginning to realize how digital technologies can be used as a means for documenting and preserving their histories and cultures. However, it is not yet clear what knowledge architectures are most appropriate for creating a digital museum in order to facilitate an effective collection, organization, conservation, and experience of cultural and artistic heritage. In this paper, we discuss the concept of ``fluid ontologies,'' a novel, dynamic structure for organizing and browsing knowledge in a digital museum. Fluid ontologies are flexible knowledge structures that evolve and adapt to communities' interest based on contextual information articulated by human contributors, curators, and viewers, as well as artificial bots that are able to track interaction histories and infer relationships among knowledge pieces and preferences of viewers. Fluid ontologies allow for a tighter coupling between communities' interests and the browsing structure of a digital museum. We present the key ideas behind the use of fluid ontologies within the context of digital museum design and seminal work in metadata/dynamic ontologies, particularly as it pertains to objects of cultural heritage, and discuss these characteristics in three concrete examples: (1) Village Voice, an online agora that ties together the narratives created by a group of Somali refugees using an iteration of community-designed ontologies, (2) Eventspace, a nodebased collaborative archive for design activities, and (3) Tribal Peace, an online digital museum still under construction and evaluation that uses proactive agents to tie distributed Kumeyaay, Luiseno, and Cupeno reservations together in their quest to achieve greater political sovereignty.},

Should continuity with the distant past be seen as simply a nationalist fiction or is it transformed by local historical imagination?While recent anthropological studies have focused on reconstructing disputed histories, this book examines the multiple ways in which the past is used by people as a critical resource for interpreting the meanings of a changing present. It poses the issue of the felt relevance of the past in constructing present day identities. The Greek island of Kalymnos is a barren and seemingly bucolic setting of tourist imagination. But its history has been one of almost continuous occupation by foreign powers and of often fierce resistance. This has made Kalymnians particularly sensitive to seeing their island in a much wider context and to understanding the 'games played by the powerful'. In examining changing gender relations, European integration, and local perceptions of the war in the former Yugoslavia, this book brings together local, national and international perspectives in a unified field. Controversial contemporary practices of dynamite throwing and dowry giving serve as tropes through which Kalymnians explore alternative ways of living in a changing world. Further, the author argues persuasively for the crucial importance of situated fieldwork in 'peripheral'places in understanding the issues and conflicts of a transnational world. This book serves as an highly readable case study of the complex connections between local and global discourses and practices, and how they are shaped by their relationship to the past},

This work, utilizing archaeological, ethnohistorical, documentary, and oral history evidence, traces the economic and social effects that the rise and ultimate supremacy of capitalist organized production in the form of the hacienda system had on native Maya social organization in the northern Yucat{\'a}n peninsula. Archaeological investigations conducted on the grounds of the former Hacienda San Juan Bautista Tabi reveal how the local, expressed in material culture remains and the landscape of the hacienda, articulated with larger global processes to create change in the lives of those individuals incorporated within the hacienda system. Fundamental shifts in the organization and relations of production led to new forms of domestic organization and new expressions of social status, wealth, and power within the physical and social landscape of the hacienda. Using a total history approach, this volume explores how changes in the lives of the workers at the hacienda reflect historically particular local negotiations with the social, political, and economic realities of an evolving global system of capitalist based production, circulation, and consumption"--},

  abstract = {I A NUMBER of strands in contemporary politics turn on the need, sometimes the demand, for recognition. The need, it can be argued, is one of the driving forces behind nationalist movements in politics. And the demand comes to the fore in a number of ways in today's politics, on behalf of minority or ``subaltern'' groups, in some forms of feminism and in what is today called the politics of ``multiculturalism.'' The demand for recognition in these latter cases is given urgency by the supposed links between recognition and identity, where this latter term designates something like a person's understanding of who they are, of their fundamental defining characteristics as a human being. The thesis is that our identity is partly shaped by recognition or its absence, often by the misrecognition of others, and so a person or group of people can suffer real damage, real distortion, if the people or society around them mirror back to them a confining or demeaning or contemptible picture of themselves. Nonrecognition or misrecognition can inflict harm, can be a form of oppression, imprisoning someone in a false, distorted, and reduced mode of being. Thus some feminists have argued that women in patriarchal societies have been induced to adopt a depreciatory image of themselves. They have internalized a picture of their own inferiority, so that even when some of the objective obstacles to their advancement fall away, they may be incapable of taking advantage of the new opportunities.

Se trata de una reflexi{\'o}n sobre la ley, el cambio social e institucional y las culturas jur{\'i}dicas en el mundo rural mexicano. A partir de la observaci{\'o}n etnogr{\'a}fica en el sur de Yucat{\'a}n, este libro explora las m{\'u}ltiples apropiaciones, interpretaciones, evasiones y resistencias que una variedad de actores han hecho del ejido. El an{\'a}lisis antropol{\'o}gico se conjuga adem{\'a}s con una perspectiva hist{\'o}rica para reconstruir los procesos que trastocaron los principios rectores que dieron sentido al ejido posrevolucionario a lo largo del siglo XX. En espec{\'i}fico, se examina la privatizaci{\'o}n y mercantilizaci{\'o}n de las tierras ejidales, antes y despu{\'e}s de la reforma legal de 1992 al art{\'i}culo 27 constitucional, desde un conjunto de preguntas: la Ley, comprendida como el proyecto de orden social generado desde el Estado, {\textquestiondown}qu{\'e} tan efectiva es para generar cambio social? {\textquestiondown}C{\'o}mo permea y es, a su vez, permeada por las actores sociales que intenta normar? {\textquestiondown}Qu{\'e} relaci{\'o}n de mutua influencia existe entre, y la ley y los ``usos u costumbres'' ind{\'i}genas? {\textquestiondown}Qu{\'e} principio social, ideol{\'o}gico y moral justifica, hoy en d{\'i}a, la tenencia ejidal? En suma, este libro analiza el funcionamiento y la efectividad de la ley, en el marco de una reforma de corte neoliberal que al buscar legalizar ciertas pr{\'a}cticas sociales, gener{\'o} nuevas irregularidades o anomal{\'i}as al interior de los ejidos.},

  abstract = {Because computers zoom across magnifications, it is easy to conclude that both knowledge and things exist by nature in precision-nested scales. The technical term is ``scalable,'' the ability to expand without distorting the framework. But it takes hard work to make knowledge and things scalable, and this article shows that ignoring nonscalable effects is a bad idea. People stumbled on scalable projects through the same historical contingencies that such projects set out to deny. They cobbled together ways to make things and data self-contained and static, and thus amenable to expansion. In European New World plantations, the natives were wiped out; coerced and alienated plants and workers came to substitute for them. Profits were made because extermination and slavery could be discounted from the books. Such historically indeterminate encounters formed models for later projects of scalability. This essay explores scalability projects from the perspective of an emergent ``nonscalability theory'' that pays attention to the mounting pile of ruins that scalability leaves behind. The article concludes that, if the world is still diverse and dynamic, it is because scalability never fulfills its own promises.},

The number of new ideas a team can generate in a given amount of time correlates directly to its capacity to solve problems and devise breakthrough solutions. This is ideaflow, and companies like Apple, Amazon, and Toyota dominate because they have far more of it. Ideaflow is the most crucial business metric because every business problem is fundamentally an idea problem. When ideas are scarce, so are profits. Your team's capacity to quickly and efficiently generate enough potential solutions, as well as design, test, and launch winning products and services, is decisive. Drawing from decades spent helping Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Fortune 500 executives, as well as leadership roles at innovative companies, Klebahn and Utley offer a battle-tested framework to exponentially boost ideaflow in yourself and your team. You'll learn how to: Strengthen creative output with a brief daily practice Rapidly generate a flood of new ideas under enormous pressure Run cheap, fast, and efficient real-world tests of your ideas to choose the 10x winners Encourage and incentivize ideaflow across teams and organizations Are you ready to supercharge your organization's results?"--},

  abstract = {Impurity conveyed by fluids is a symbol and a tool for gender and caste discrimination in India. These fluids occupy asymmetric functions in the creation of kinship and gender relationships. Their circulation between bodies therefore requires a strict control; not prohibiting contact between castes, but ensuring a one-way transmission linked to a relation of power and subordination which is also related to the reproduction of the clans. Taking our ethnographic data from a Himalayan valley as a point of departure, we will situate this ``mechanic of fluids'' with regard to some classical theories of impurity, offering our own renewed and current interpretation. Analizamos aqu{\'i} el concepto de ``impureza'' transmitida por los fluidos, impureza que es s{\'i}mbolo e instrumento de la discriminaci{\'o}n de castas y de g{\'e}nero en la India. Estos fluidos ocupan funciones asim{\'e}tricas en la creaci{\'o}n de los v{\'i}nculos de parentesco, en el funcionamiento del sistema de castas o la jerarqu{\'i}a de g{\'e}nero. Su circulaci{\'o}n entre los diferentes cuerpos requiere as{\'i} un control estricto, no prohibiendo el contacto entre castas sino vigilando mantener una transmisi{\'o}n en sentido {\'u}nico, vinculada a una relaci{\'o}n de poder/subordinaci{\'o}n que a su vez tiene que ver con la reproducci{\'o}n de los clanes. A partir de nuestros datos etnogr{\'a}ficos de un valle del Himalaya indio, situaremos esta mec{\'a}nica de fluidos frente a algunas teor{\'i}as de la impureza, para proponer una visi{\'o}n renovada y actual de esta. Lan honetan isurien bidez transmititutako ezpurutasun kontzeptua aztertuko dugu. Kastak eta generoak diskriminatzeko sinboloa eta tresna da ezpurutasuna Indian. Isuriek funtzio asimetrikoak dituzte senidetza-loturen sorkuntzan, kasta-sistemaren funtzionamenduan zein genero-hierarkian. Isurien gorputz arteko zirkulazioak kontrol zorrotza eskatzen du; ez da kasten arteko kontaktua debekatzen, baina zaindu egin behar izaten da transmisioa norabide bakarrean mantentzea; izan ere, botere/subordinazio erlazioarekin loturik dago, eta azken horrek zerikusia du klanen erreprodukzioarekin. Indiako Himalaiako ibar batean bildu ditugun datu etnografikoetatik abiatuta, hizpide dugun isurien mekanika kontrajarriko diegu ezpurutasunaren zenbait teoriari; halaber, ezpurutasunari buruzko ikuspegi berritua eta eguneratua proposatuko dugu.},

  abstract = {The increasing adoption and widespread use of social media provides significant opportunities for social scientists to discover novel insights of varying aspects of human behaviour. In response to increasing interest and research in this area, a wide variety of theoretical, methodological frameworks, guidelines and software tools have emerged. However, tools for collecting and analysing social media data are often inaccessible or unsuitable for social scientists. This is often due to interdisciplinary challenges that conflict with social scientists' research aims, objectives and methodological approaches towards collecting and analysing social media. To address this, we are developing an extensible open source platform to support social scientists' research in this area. This platform provides the means to collect and annotate social media data which can then be used to construct a knowledge graph. The knowledge graph provides social scientists with the means to consider their analysis within a broader context that may yield further insights.},

Lo que ha matado a este sistema es el propio capital y los cambios tecnol{\'o}gicos acelerados de las {\'u}ltimas dos d{\'e}cadas, que, como un virus, han acabado con su hu{\'e}sped. {\'E}sta es la principal conclusi{\'o}n a la que ha llegado el prestigioso economista Yanis Varoufakis tras a{\~n}os de estudio dedicados a desentra{\~n}ar el origen y la transformaci{\'o}n del sistema econ{\'o}mico mundial. Los dos pilares en los que se asentaba el capitalismo han sido reemplazados: los mercados, por plataformas digitales que son aut{\'e}nticos feudos de lasbig tech; el beneficio, por la pura extracci{\'o}n de rentas. A partir de esta observaci{\'o}n, confirmada por la crisis de 2008 y la provocada por la pandemia, Varoufakis ha desarrollado su teor{\'i}a del <<tecnofeudalismo>>, seg{\'u}n la cual los nuevos se{\~n}ores feudales son los propietarios de lo que llama <<capital de la nube>>, y los dem{\'a}s hemos vuelto a ser siervos, como en el medievo.

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

The study starts with an examination of the African presence in historical perspective, as well as the economic and social role of Africans and their descendants in Mexico. Then, it engages with the different definitions employed to classify and categorize the African populations, and its links with the expansion of the transatlantic slave trade. In the last section, I examine how categories and classifications were employed, in order to stress how their uses were complex, ambiguous, and arbitrary. Despite the existence of social and racial classifications, social mobility and interactions prevailed in colonial Mexico, making efforts to classify and rank people even more subjective and problematic.},

From a critic analysis of the various positions of the so called new rurality, we adopted this concept under the rural individuals approach. The aforementioned forces the reformulation of the development models that rest, mostly in a sectorial rural definition in order to pass to a proposal that expands the territorial look and the multifuncionality of agriculture. The territory emerges in this way as an analysis category and at the same time it's a political proposal about the rural World that tries to shed light on the series of transformations that exceeds the conventional limits, assuming an integral, transdisciplinary and global approach.},

It traces the term `spatial justice' as introduced through the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act and it looks at the underlying view of space that has influenced the spatial turn in law. It furthermore investigates the ways in which the spatial turn in law has been influenced by the thinking of Henri Lefebvre, who relies on a Leibnizian conception of space. Lastly the link between Leibniz and legal positivism is considered in order to reach the final conclusion in the form of a caution against merely adding the language of spatial justice to an approach to space that remains caught up in abstract space. This will only further entrench existing fault lines in society. For this conclusion the work of Roger Berkowitz is central. Berkowitz argues convincingly that the work of Leibniz was central in the development of legal positivism, despite Leibniz in general being considered as a natural law thinker. The same applies to spatial justice theory, where the work of Leibniz is central: it may present the possibilities of another law -- the law as it ought to be. The law conceptualised as `ought' instead of `is' would promote reconciliation. Alternatively, spatial justice can simply present the law as it `is' and reconfirm and deepen the chasms in our world.},

Official multiculturalism does not necessarily lead to reducing racism, and may even remain as a set of rhetorical gestures. It is necessary to focus on racism and the concept of ``race'' as phenomena with their own history and social strength. The marginalization of the concept of ``race'' in discussions about inequality in Latin America is examined here, and it is argued that it is necessary to see Latin America as an integral part of the ``black Americas''. I argue that the concept of ``race'' has been manifest in Latin America more than has been commonly assumed. I propose that issues of ``race'' and racism are gaining more public space in Colombia (and Brazil). Multiculturalism has to be understood as a battle ground in order to define its political effects.},

  abstract = {Over more than a century, a growing body of books, articles, and dissertations has emerged that can now be recognized as part of the archaeology of ethnogenesis. Regardless of whether this work concerns people in the far reaches of antiquity or the more recent past, archaeologists are grappling with a variety of social forces, historical processes, contexts, and dimensions of social identity making. As with much contemporary anthropological social theory, prevalent themes include politics and economics as well as specific topics such as colonialism, frontiers, ethnonymy, persistence, nativism, migration, instrumentalism, slavery, and religion. There are few major regions of the world where archaeologists have not applied ethnicity or ethnogenesis theories. Although many archaeologists' attitudes toward investigating these forms of social identity involve skepticism or ambivalence, there is growing support. For similar and different reasons, native and descendent communities share this range of opinions about ethnogenetic research.},

  abstract = {Objective:               The objective was to conduct meta-analyses that investigated the effects of two training strategies, increasing difficulty (ID) and part-task training (PTT), on transfer of skills and the variables that moderate effectiveness of the strategies.                                         Background:               Cognitive load theory (CLT) provides a basis for predicting that training strategies reducing the intrinsic load of a task during training avail more resources to be devoted to learning. Two strategies that accomplish this goal, by dividing tasks in parts or by simplifying tasks in early training trials, have offered only mixed success.                                         Method:               A pair of complementary effect size measures were used in the meta-analyses conducted on 37 transfer studies employing the two training strategies: (a) a transfer ratio analysis on the ratio of treatment transfer performance to control transfer performance and (b) a Hedges' g analysis on the standardized difference between treatment and control group means.                                         Results:               PTT generally produced negative transfer when the parts were performed concurrently in the whole transfer task but not when the parts were performed in sequence. Variable-priority training of the whole task was a successful technique. ID training was successful when the increases were implemented adaptively but not when increased in fixed steps. Both strategies provided evidence that experienced learners benefited less, or suffered more, from the strategy, consistent with CLT.                                         Conclusion:               PTT can be successful if the integrated parts are varied in the priority they are given to the learner. ID training is successful if the increases are adaptive. The fundamental elements of CLT are confirmed.},

For these multi-local individuals, the discursive and material aspects of New Zealand as home form a framework for their everyday life as migrants living in London. Interpretation of the interviews using thematic and narrative analyses works through a conceptualization of home, migration, and identity as interdependent, through three interrelated themes: the symbolic or political nature of home; the importance of family and familiarity for a sense of home; and the role of physical material objects and places. Participants in this study see New Zealand as their home, yet by being away from home they gain new perspectives on home. In London, they engage with or resist a collective imaginary of New Zealand as home that is both self-perpetuated and externally imposed, and which both reveals and conceals ideas about individual and group identity and community. On returning from London, the idealistic and sometimes simplistic visions of New Zealand as home that structure their lives in London are often disrupted by the more complex yet more mundane version of home and self with which they are confronted.},

The author introduces a multilevel process theory to understand how these characteristics are generated and transformed over time. The theory assumes that ethnic boundaries are the outcome of the classificatory struggles and negotiations between actors situated in a social field. Three characteristics of a field---the institutional order, distribution of power, and political networks---determine which actors will adopt which strategy of ethnic boundary making. The author then discusses the conditions under which these negotiations will lead to a shared understanding of the location and meaning of boundaries. The nature of this consensus explains the particular characteristics of an ethnic boundary. A final section i...},
